I believe you all raised electronic chickens when you were young? Maybe your share of innocence hasn't disappeared yet. This time, I'm going to recommend a method that can be implemented without spending money. You can rely on "Touchbar Pet" to raise electronic chickens on the MacBook Pro laptop Touch Bar.

## It's not difficult to raise electronic chickens with Touch Bar

I believe everyone knows that in 2016, Apple introduced the Touch Bar for the MacBook Pro. The original physical buttons can be used to adjust the volume, screen brightness, and music control keys by using the touch bar directly. But can this space only display the control buttons?

Some foreign developers, Grace Avery, have used their creativity to change the position of the Touch Bar ’s touch bar into an electronic chicken space, and developed a very unique pet-growing game “Touchbar "Pet", the overall design is very healing, so that users can also call the electronic chicken to recall the joy of childhood when working and leisure.

At present, it is only a beta demo version. At first it will be an egg on the touch bar.

If you touch it with your fingers, the egg will spread a cat with only two feet, but there is a long tail at the back, and the health and hunger index will be displayed next to the Touch Bar.

## What will happen to Touchbar Pet?

According to the author, it can be achieved in infants, childhood and old age, and may even starve to death. It will continue to update and add various new gameplay.

 

## Why does Touchbar Pet lose health?

Pet is too hungry (hunger value reaches 10)
Pets are too full
Pet environment is too dirty to clean up too much
Pets have n’t played for too long, causing them to fall out of favor, remember to open and pat them
 

## How to restore health?

When your pet is sick, you can feed and get enough sleep, let your pets take at least four nap times, and wake them up to recover their health. At the same time, make sure that they are healthy. Feed and care for them often, and keep the environment clean to prevent you from waking up suddenly from a nap, which will make you angry.

 

## How to install Touchbar Pet?

This game only runs on MacOS 10.14 and later.

Go to the "Touchbar Pet official website" to download the app, and copy the Touchbar Pet into the application, and open it. After opening, it is normal to see the window appear blank, as long as you pay attention to the pet of the Touch Bar.
