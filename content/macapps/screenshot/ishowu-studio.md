iShowU Studio Easy screen recording & editing on your Mac: that’s the core idea. Built from day one with this in mind, it’s easy to capture what you want; add text, annotations, pointers and highlights and then share your result.

Features you’ve come to expect in the iShowU “series” have been supercharged: screen & camera capture, mouse highlighting and keyboard animations take on a new lease of life now that you can edit when and how they appear. Did we mention we’ve reworked uploading too? Take the best realtime capture, mix in “time” – and voila, iShowU Studio!

Super fast full screen capture

Utilising the latest OS X technology and hardware accelerated goodness.

Simple editing interface

An uncluttered yet useful screen recording interface, with the editing tools you need directly accessible.

Full suite of Editing Tools

Super intuitive pan/zoom, shapes, fades and more. iShowU Studio lets you point out what’s important quickly and easily.

Built specifically for screencasts

Mouse and keyboard visualization, audio annotations: just some of the tools tailored specifically for the creation of ‘screen based’ content.

Gorgeous “Full Screen” editing interface

Designed from the beginning to both operate and look fantastic when in full screen.

We love colour

iShowU Studio is aware of colour-tagged footage, giving you accurate results all the way from import, preview through to final render.

Share your creation

Get your result “out there”! The entire “share” panel focuses on what your end users need. Quicktime? No problem. Web? No problem! iDevices1? Yep! 1080p? Sure! YouTube, Vimeo as well? You got it!

Capture directly from iOS

Capture directly from your iOS device, create beautiful demos of your iOS apps with ease!

Built in Camera capture

Plug in any OS X compatible camera and capture footage from that in realtime. Or add it later, your call.

Scheduled recordings

User editable capture area

iOS device recording

Trim video before publication

Record microphone audio

Record system audio

Record camera

Record mouse movement and clicks

Record keystrokes

Edit after recording

Embed watermarks

Add shape objects (lines, arrows, etc.)

Add custom text objects

Add additional media (pictures, movies, audio)

Crop unwanted areas before publication

Freeze-frame at any time, for any duration

Camera position modification (a.k.a pan/zoom)

Full screen editing interface

Share/export directly to iPod/iPad compatible formats

Upload to YouTube

Upload to Vimeo

Integration with OS X sharing (Facebook, Airdrop, Mail, Messages, Twitter and more)

What’s New:



Version 2.2.0:



Ready for Catalina.

App is now notarized.

Fixed bug where sometimes iShowU would not record on some systems with odd numbered horizontal resolutions.

Much faster prompt for screen access (if not enabled in System Preferences).

Light mode comes to Studio 2. Use Studio2 in dark/light/auto mode as you’d like. New beautiful UI and coloring.

Lots of re-work on the codebase. Faster operation.

Redone menu bar, now flat/modern, with a more pleasing feel.

Far more subtle UI colouring now. Emphasis colors follow the System Preferences ‘accent color’.

All context UI’s given more visual space (better feel).

Changed default shortcut for retake-recording (made it cmd-shift-option-R), so it’s less likely to conflict with existing/other apps.

Reworked icons and UI, easier to look at all round.

Improved UI speed.

Various (many!) bugs fixed & internal improvements.

Greatly increased logging output when recording fails, to aid in debugging.

Compatibility: OS X 10.10 or later, 64-bit processor
