Mach Desktop brings your desktop to life with Quartz Compositions, Quicktime Movies, or Web pages. Mach Desktop also comes built-in with over 20 stunning Quartz Compositions and over 5 beautiful Quicktime movies. You can, of course, choose your own Quartz Composition, Quicktime movie, or Web page to put on the desktop as well. Unlike all other desktop applications which only offer one of these three media types, Mach Desktop offers all three media types in a single convenient application.

Mach Desktop also introduces a concept called the desktop utility, where you can have commonly used utilities living on your desktop. And if you have two displays, Mach Desktop will automatically detect it and take advantage of that. Download Mach Desktop today, and turn your desktop into the multimedia and information powerhouse it deserves to be.
