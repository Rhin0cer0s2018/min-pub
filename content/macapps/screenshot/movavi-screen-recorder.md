Movavi Screen Recorder Capture video from your Mac display with Movavi Screen Recorder! This neat video recorder for Mac will help you save live streams and video and audio clips from web pages, record your interactions in apps, capture gameplay, and do lots more screen capturing tasks!


Interface Design



We’ve created a new interface design that’s more user-friendly, more intuitive and more modern.

Onboarding Instructions



We’ve added onboarding instructions to make learning the program faster and easier.

Screenshot Sharing



Now you can share screenshots via social networks – WhatsApp, Telegram. You can also copy the image link and send it to colleagues and friends.

Enchanced Export Window



The export window has been enhanced. We’ve added the SuperSpeed tool to the saving tab, changed the location of the settings and removed the tab with the choice of output devices.

Modified Recording Panel



We’ve modified the pre-recording panel into a sidebar, so it takes less space and doesn’t block half the screen. The panel consists of two blocks – horizontal and vertical. The horizontal block helps to control recording, the vertical block controls the recording effects.

The blinking recording frame has been removed so it doesn’t distract you from recording.

Other



Minor bug fixes and improvements.

Compatibility: OS X 10.10 or later, 64-bit processor
