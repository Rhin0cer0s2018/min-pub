24 Hour Wallpaper Enjoy beautiful desktop wallpapers that change dynamically to match the time of day. Includes 58 total wallpaper sequences all professionally captured and mastered at 5K resolution. Each sequence is made of 30+ images which cover a complete 24 hour period.

Enjoy wallpaper that reflects the time of day where you are or adjust time preferences to fit your schedule and lifestyle. Compatible with Mojave Dynamic Desktop as well as macOS versions 10.11 and later (El Capitan and later).

Note for 2011-2013 iMac models on Mojave and High Sierra:

At this time the app may show glitches in the wallpaper on 2011-2013 iMac models with NVIDIA graphics cards. If you experience this issue please contact us.

The wallpapers in this app are still and change throughout the day to match the time at your current location. If you are looking for motion wallpapers that visually move please see our other apps Magic Window, Magic Window 4K, and Magic Flowers.

Locations include: 

Mojave Preserve, Yosemite, Joshua Tree, High Sierras, Grand Canyon, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Malibu, New York, London, Paris, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Sydney, Auckland, Lake Taupo, Iceland, Phuket, and more. Also includes three special painted wallpapers by Waterlogue.

This new app from the creators of Magic Window took more than seven years to create. All images in the app are professionally captured by the Magic Window team specifically for the app and are mastered to perfection.

All wallpapers are available at full 5K resolution (5120×2880). The app will allow you to download the wallpaper at the resolution most appropriate for your displays including 4K (4096×2304), 3K (2880×1800), and HD/2K (1920×1200). This means no space wasted on pixels you don’t need.

Half of the wallpapers included are from a fixed viewpoint – you get the exact same view changing to match the time of day. To achieve this we setup and manage a professional camera for 24+ hours at the same location. For the scene to work the weather and light has to be just right for 24 hours.

The other half are mixes where the view changes but the location generally remains the same. To create these we put together several time lapse sequences and still images to build a narrative wallpaper sequence that feels like spending a day exploring the location.

By default the app will use the time of day at your location. However you can customize sunrise and sunset times and durations to your liking or have it synchronize with another location. This is helpful if you work on non-standard hours.

Unlike the Magic Window series of apps the wallpapers in this app are still images set as system wallpaper. There is no visible motion which means no battery drain, no CPU drain, no GPU drain, and no interference with other applications. The wallpaper works with all facets of macOS including Mission Control, Spaces, Expose, and the login/lock screen.

Internet access is required to download scenes. The app includes only low-resolution previews by default. Without internet access to download scenes resolution is limited to 1920×1200.
