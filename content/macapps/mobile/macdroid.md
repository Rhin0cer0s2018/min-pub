MacDroid Transfer photos, videos, music and folders between your Mac computer and your Android device connected via USB. All you’ll need is MacDroid.

Mount Android as a disk on Mac

Both internal and external storages of Android can be mounted

Edit Android files on Mac without copying them on computer

You’ll only need MacDroid and an Android connected to Mac via USB

MacDroid supports all Android and MTP devices

Transfer your recent photos

Some great photos you just took on your Android can be transferred on your Mac or edited there even without transferring.

Work with entire folders

You can move entire folders between your Mac and Android and always have the most up-to-date documentation on your devices.

Watch a TV show on a long flight

If you have new episodes on your computer that you’d like to watch on your device while offline – MacDroid will transfer them.

Edit files directly on Android

You don’t even have to save your Android files on Mac to edit them. Just connect your phone, edit the files on Mac and save changes once done.

Add new music to your phone

Transfer your favorite tracks from Mac to Android or vice versa and enjoy the music everywhere you are.

Any MTP device is supported

Got more devices that connect in MTP mode? Work with them in MacDroid just like you would with your Android device.

Compatibility: OS X 10.10.0 or later
