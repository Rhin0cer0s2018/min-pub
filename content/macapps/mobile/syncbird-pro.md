SyncBird Pro is an iPhone file manager that makes iOS sync and iTunes cleaning at a glance. Transfer music, playlists, photos, videos, books–everything–between your iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Mac without using iTunes. SyncBird’s exclusive features named PhoneCare and TunesClean are made to reclaim more free space on your iPhone and iTunes. Without extra effort, SyncBird will give you a daily, thorough cleanup so that you’ll be always free from the storage boundary.

Better design yields better products, so we challenged ourselves to bring Google Material Design to the new macOS platform. The surface, motion, color, and every element in SyncBird, were chosen to give you an exciting and delightful experience.
