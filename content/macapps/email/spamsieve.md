SpamSieve is a robust spam filter for major email clients using a powerful Bayesian spam filtering.

SpamSieve understand what your spam looks to block everything, but also learn what their legitimate messages seem to avoid confusion. SpamSieve only marks the spam in your email client so you never lose any mail.

SpamSieve gives back your inbox, using powerful Bayesian spam filtering to provide incredible accuracy that is constantly improving.

Itâ€™s fast and easy to control SpamSieve from Apple Mail, Entourage, Mailsmith, Outlook, Postbox, PowerMail and more.

SpamSieve learns and adapts to your mail, so it is able to block nearly all the junk-without putting good messages in the mailbox of spam.

Deactivate the notification of new mail in your email client and let SpamSieve notify you only when you receive new messages not spam.

Automatically maintains a whitelist to guarantee that messages from previous correspondents never be marked as spam.

It integrates with your address book so that the messages from your friends and colleagues always reach your inbox.

Maintains a blocklist so you can instantly adapt to spam messages sent from particular addresses and capture 100% of them.

Customize the whitelist and blocklist adding your own rules. Using a variety of criteria, p. regular expressions to match different parts of the message.

Spammers encode and obfuscate their messages and use phishing tactics, but SpamSieve can decode messages to discern their true nature.

SpamSieve looks into images and attachments to detect spam content, even when the message itself is virtually empty.

The colors show how each message is spam, so you can quickly focus on the limits if you want to check the work of SpamSieve.


SpamSieve keeps track of exactly what it is, how many good and spam messages you receive, and how these numbers change over time.

Registration allows you to see everything that SpamSieve did, and why, so you can adjust the settings if necessary.

Compatibility: OS X 10.7 or later 64 bit
