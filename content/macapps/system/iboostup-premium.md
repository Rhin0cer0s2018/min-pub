Has your Mac become slow and unresponsive? Has it lost some of the zing it used to have? Are you getting unexpected crashes and error messages? Is your Macbook getting hot and the fan running constantly? If so, you need to download iBoostUp!

iBoostUp tunes up and optimizes your Mac by purging unneeded files, fixing your hard disk, giving you performance recommendations, protecting your privacy by removing cookies, showing you easily accessible system information, and much more!

iBoostUp’s Memory Booster allows you to view detailed system memory information, and optionally free up memory with its “Boost Now” functionality (Boost Now is available to users of Mac OS Lion or above via in-app purchase).

iBoostUp’s Duplicate File Finder helps you regain disk space and reduce clutter by searching for files with identical content, irrespective of location or filename. Duplicate File Finder gives you the opportunity to review and select individual files for removal, but rest assured that in case of inadvertent deletion your files are recoverable from Mac OS’s Trash until emptied. (Duplicate Finder is available to Mac OS Lion users or above via in-app purchase).

ARP Cache Poisoning is a hacking technique used to eavesdrop and otherwise manipulate your network traffic. It is of particular concern when connected to untrusted networks such as those found at airports, hotels and cafes.

With iBoostUp’s ARP Cache Poisoning Detector you can scan for or be automatically alerted on suspicious network activity. (available to Mac OS Lion or above users via in-app purchase)

Reclaim more disk space by using iBoostUp’s Application Uninstaller to seek out and remove application related files instead of simply dragging an app to the Trash. (available to Mac OS Lion or above users via in-app purchase)

Old and Unused File scanner

Searching for old and unused files on your Mac helps reduce clutter and free up disk space (free for premium users, available to other Mac OS Lion or above users via in-app purchase)

Disk Usage Tool

Track down which files and folders consume the most space in your home folder, your Mac’s internal or any removable disk. Our Disk Usage Tool is completely free for all users.

iBoostUp now features App Viewer!

App Viewer examines your selected application to display useful and not always easily accessible information. App Viewer is completely free for all users.
