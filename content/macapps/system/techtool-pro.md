TechTool Pro has long been one of the foremost utilities for keeping your Mac running smoothly and efficiently. With the release of version 12, it has become more proficient than ever. Techtool Pro 12 is compatible with all current Macintosh models and system versions.

New In TechTool Pro:

Catalina Compatibility

Techtool Pro 12 now works with macOS 10.15, Catalina, and takes advantage of the new technology made available through Apple’s latest OS.

SMART Check supports USB drives

Techtool Pro 12 now includes an option to install a driver which provides access to the SMART Data available on USB drives, but previously inaccessible to the system.

More Customizable

Techtool Pro 12 introduces Check Computer Suites. Quickly switch between either built-in suites or suites that you make yourself. Want to start a group of tests, but don’t have time for the Full Suite, choose either the Intermediate or Quick Suites, or build your own exactly the way you want it.

Internal Improvements

Techtool Pro 12 continues to improve internally. We continue to update many of the tests and tools to use newer technologies to keep your Mac running smoothly. You may experience some of these improvements in the Cloning tool, the SMART Check test and every test or tool that lists drives available for test or repair.

System Requirements:

– Intel-based Macs

– OS X 10.10 up to macOS 10.14 ‘Mojave’

– 2 GB RAM or higher
