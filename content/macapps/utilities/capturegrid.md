CaptureGRID is a digital photography work flow application for tethered shooting, remote capture and advanced camera control. CaptureGRID supports all recent DSLR cameras from Canon and Nikon, as well as some cameras from the Sony Alpha range. We regularly update the app, so support for new cameras is added as they come on to the market.

The software uses wired USB connection for direct communication with the cameras, using our custom built PTP engine. This delivers reliable camera control and fast photo downloads.


Compatibility: macOS 10.12 or later 64-bit
