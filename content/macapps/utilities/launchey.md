“Great Utility tool.

Love Launchey! Nice little Utility tool. It’s SO HANDY! wondering why no one thought of that before?!!” – by Amphetamine

“Very Good App.

I was looking for an app that would list all apps and quickly launch them. I tried Launchey and was very pleased with the results. It did all that I was looking for in the app. I had several questions and suggestions. I emailed the developer and he responded very quickly. Within 20 minutes, even though there is 7 time zones different. I recommend Lauchey.” – by pcsnet
