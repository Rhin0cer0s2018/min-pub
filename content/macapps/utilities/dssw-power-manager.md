DSSW Power Manager is the solution for reducing the energy costs of Mac computers. Use Power Manager to assert control over when your Macs are available and when they are switched off. Power Manager extends the scheduling functionality provided by OS X’s Energy Saver. Unlike Energy Saver, Power Manager is aware of multiple users, offers unrestricted schedules, provides greater customisation, and supports a wider range of actions.


Power Manager extends the scheduling functionality provided by OS X’s Energy Saver. Unlike Energy Saver, Power Manager is aware of multiple users, offers unrestricted schedules, provides greater customisation, and supports a wider range of actions.

Power Manager includes the ability to schedule applications, launch documents, and run scripts. Includes AppleScript support, Automator actions, command-line interface, and programming interface.

Power Manager 4.x’s application reveals more information about the events and scheduling engine. The application now offers two views: the events store and the engine.

The events store shows all the events available to the scheduler, including those that are disabled. This view builds upon the previous interface. Here, events are created, named, and managed.

The new engine view shows events as they exist within the scheduler. An event with two timed triggers will appear twice within the engine view; once for each trigger time. From the engine view, scheduled events can be adjusted, triggered, and cancelled. These actions were previously only possible through the status menu.

Power Manager is now distributed as an application, rather than an Installer package. As with other applications, to install, the application only needs to be placed within the Applications folder. Power Manager does this automatically. So, a double-click is all that is needed after downloading. Then, the application guides the user through setting up the scheduler without needing to restart or deal with Installer packages.

Mac Platform: Intel, 64-bit processor OS X 10.10 or later
