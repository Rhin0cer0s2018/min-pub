TrashMe is a powerful uninstaller with other great useful tools to clean your Mac.

You’ve probably ever thought that an application only needs to be moved to your Trash to get uninstalled? This is not completely true, as many files would be left behind, those files created by the application (temporary files, caches, settings…). With TrashMe, you’ll never let those files tidying up your Mac!

Main Features

Trash any application, widget, plugin and preference pane easily

Find all related files that need to be deleted too

Protect application from being uninstalled

Automatically detect an application moved to the Trash and delete its related files

Tools



Manage a list of favorite applications and store registration info securely

Clean macOS caches to solve some issues and free up hard disk space

Force empty your Trash when some files can’t be deleted with Finder

Choose to delete only particular files in your Trash instead of whole Trash

Delete junk files (files such as Desktop.ini, incomplete downloads, orphans…)

Get a warning when your Trash is full

What’s New:



Version 2.1.22



Fixed a crash occurring when emptying the Trash

Fixed other small issues
