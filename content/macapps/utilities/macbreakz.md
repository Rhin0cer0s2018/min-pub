MacBreakZ is a sophisticated Personal Ergonomic Assistant designed to promote healthy and productive computer use. Computer-related health problems ranging from eyestrain, headaches, neck, wrist, elbow and back pain to more severe Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSI), including carpal tunnel syndrome, writer’s cramp, tendonitis, etc. are the result of inappropriate computer use. MacBreakZ offers a unique way of acquiring ergonomic skills that can save you a lot of discomfort and shield you from serious health and career-threatening injury.

Show & Tell

The break reminder component of MacBreakZ features sophisticated keyboard and mouse monitoring (without invading your privacy*) that allows it to react to the way you are using your computer. What’s more MacBreakZ provides you with instant feedback on how you are doing and thus lets you find out more about your work practices.

Suggest, Teach & Demonstrate

Based on your actual keyboard and mouse use and the time you have spent in front of the screen, MacBreakZ suggests rest and micro breaks at appropriate intervals. MacBreakZ includes a set of 42 fully illustrated stretching exercises that are designed to reduce muscular tension, improve posture and strengthen appropriate muscle groups. It also features dozens of great ergonomic tips.

Adapt

MacBreakZ adapts to how and where you work. A sophisticated setup assistant makes sure that you start off with a configuration that suits you and your workplace. An extensive array of preferences allow you to customize everything from how activity is measured to the way information is presented on the screen.

Tactful & Discreet

MacBreakZ isn’t rude and just interrupts you in the middle of something important. Through its innovative interface using transparency and sound, it keeps you informed without stealing your focus and gives you plenty of warning before a break is due and even then respectfully waits until you have stopped working. You may of course also temporarily disable MacBreakZ for that all important presentation.

Serious Fun

Healthy computing does not have to feel “medical”. MacBreakZ features a “serious fun” interface that uses everything that Mac OS X has to offer from transparency effects to the sound interface. Lead artist, Nick Miller, also supplies a range of laid back stretching illustrations.

Plain Serious

MacBreakZ also features information displays and an illustration style that suit a more formal open plan office setting. A special “stealth” mode encodes all essential information into a inconspicuous menu bar item for those who do not wish to broadcast the fact that they are using the product. You can even take your stretches with you anywhere by using our StretchZ for iPhone/ iPod touch.
