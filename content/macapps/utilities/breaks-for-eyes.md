Breaks for Eyes 2 is here! A bunch of whole new things together with major improvements will bring your eye-care to a totally different level.

A gorgeous new icon

We worked with the great @darranmorris to make a new sparkling icon for Breaks for Eyes, now it has one more way to please your eyes!

Notification-only breaks

Blocked out screen can be annoying sometimes. Say, if you're holding a keynote or are deeply concentrated on a coding task? We introduce all-new type of breaks to solve this. Whenever a break is due, you'll see an unobtrusive push notification for exactly 20 seconds, the duration of a normal break. No blocked screen, no interruped workflow. Clean and simple.

Ever had a headache, dry or red eyes, fatigue or neck pain at the end of the day? This app is for you then!

It's all the symptoms of computer vision syndrome (or CVS). About 90% of computer workers have it.

If you're focusing on a computer screen for too long, your eyes don't recover from the strain, and it causes a bunch of problems.

Breaks For Eyes helps you overcome all the symptoms with a 20-20-20 rule, which is a medically proven way to knockdown eye strain & computer vision syndrome!

The app reminds you to take a 20-second break every 20 minutes & look at something 20 ft (6 m) away.

You can disable break reminders for some time (30 min, 1h, 2h, 4h, a day) if you're in a meeting or watching a movie. Click the button in the menu bar to do so.

Take care of your eyes!

Compatibility: macOS 10.13 or later 64-bit
