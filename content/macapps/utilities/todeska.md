The First and Only App to Transform Today Extensions into Desktop Widgets. Bring new life to Apple widgets today!

How does it Work? This was made possible after extensive reverse engineering of Notification Center itself. Once this was done, a complete reimplementation of the extension hosting capability was built from the ground up. Now you can enjoy Today Extensions however YOU want to!

Features:

• Customizable Windows
• Multi-Monitor Support
• Automatically Match System Appearence

Release Notes Version 1.4.1:

-A few fixes for the preferences window

-Fix crash for some 10.14 users

Compatibility: macOS 10.14 or later
