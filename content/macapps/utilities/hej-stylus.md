This is Hej Stylus! – the first global pen stabilization app for Mac! Hej Stylus! is minimalistic menu bar application. It makes your cursor behave like a brush. The result is super precise cursor steering and stroke smoothing.

– 2 POSITION SMOOTHING METHODS

– PRESSURE SMOOTHING AND BUFFERING

– INSTANT PRESSURE MAPPING

– EXCHANGEABLE PRESETS

– TILT AND ROTATION SMOOTHING

– WORKING WITH ANY ART SOFTWARE ON A MAC



DRAWING, BUT LIKE BETTER!

Hej Stylus! is a control system for your graphic tablets pen, mouse or other input method.



Gain control over the smoothness of your lines – damp out little irregularities up to using Hej Stylus! like a ruler. It’s pressure control system lets you define pressure control
curves has pressure smoothing and buffering. Also the tilt and rotational information that is delivered by the graphics tablet can be processed.



You can store, recall and exchange your personal presets with others. This gives you a wide range of possibilities to configure your pen, mouse or other input method to create
awesome art with any software that is running on a mac.



What’s new in Hej Stylus! v3.0

Version 3.0 has a lot more to offer. There are a variety of things that can be smoothed and stabilized now: Position, pressure, tilt and rotation. You can also define how the
pressure is transferred – like a hard medium or soft/wet medium or even reversing the pressure is possible. Finally you can store, recall, manage and exchange your personal presets
with your colleagues and friends.



Pressure Mapping

The new pressure mapping function takes the pressure output of your stylus and maps it along the either a linear function or bezier function. Emulate hart/soft media behavior – even
invert pressure. Or just go wild with the bezier function and make your lines look like gooey ink. All this is possible. Now.



New Position Smoothing Method

The new position algorithm compares your cursor position to its prior one. Drag the slider a bit to remove small noise – drag it all to the right to draw straight lines. This
smoothing method is very suitable for painters hence it can be very subtile and fast at the same time. It also catches up to your ‘line-ending’ position.



Pressure Smoothing / Buffer

Pressure Smoothing works like the new Position Smoothing Method and is suitable for casual sketching/drawing and painting.



The Pressure Buffer works like a stack of values: beginning with 0 it starts collecting data and creates an average on a given buffer size. It is very useful for building up the
line smoothly and keeping it steady – while crosshatching for example. The cooling-off-time can be pretty long – depending on your buffer size.



Tilt and Rotation Smoothing

Tilt and Rotation Smoothing works also like the new Position Smoothing Method.

Painting with large, rake-like brushes is now more powerful than ever before



Requirements: osX 10.10, osX 10.11 and macOS 10.12
