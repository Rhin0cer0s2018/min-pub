Umbra The missing app for Dark Mode.

Toggle dark mode from anywhere with a single click

Set wallpapers for both light & dark appearances

Umbra is a tiny app that addresses both of these shortcomings. It lets you designate an image, or a gallery, for each theme, and it makes it easier to switch between Dark and Light mode via a simple menu bar icon.

Set your preferred wallpapers for each theme

To begin with, open the app's configuration screen and find the images you wish to assign to the Dark and Light modes. This can be one by either navigating to their location or using drag and drop actions.

If you want to use more than one image for each theme, just place them in a folder, which you will then select. The app will simply choose a random image from that location whenever you switch between themes.

Toggle between Dark and Light mode with one click

Once you've set your wallpapers, the app will continue running in the background and can be accessed from the menu bar should you wish to select different images or change other preferences.

If all you want is to switch between Dark and Light mode, however, simply hold down the ‚å• (option) key and click the icon. This feature can home in handy if you frequently switch between themes, and it is certainly faster than the classic method.

It's simple and lightweight, and it does the job

Not much else can be said about Umbra, as the app doesn't offer a lot of features, but the ones it does include work without a hitch. If you need a quicker way to switch between themes and want to use different wallpapers for Dark and Light mode, go ahead and give it a try.
