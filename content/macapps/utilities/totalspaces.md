TotalSpaces  Rather than the linear row of Spaces that is provided by Mission Control, TotalSpaces2 allows you to create a grid that can be navigated with keyboard shortcuts and trackpad gestures

One of the most useful features of TotalSpaces2 is that it allows you to assign certain applications to particular Spaces. This means that if you have a 3×3 grid, you can ensure that your Twitter client is always in the top left space and that your email client is always in the middle right.

Switching between applications using Command Tab, by default, displays the applications in the order they have been most recently used. this means that your email client may require a different number of Tab presses each time you switch to it.

By using TotalSpaces2 to assign it to a specific position in a grid, you can rapidly and reliably switch to it at will.

TotalSpaces2 is especially useful on smaller screened devices, such as the MacBook Air line. On larger screens it is possible to display two programs side by side, however, on 13″ and smaller screens, things become very cramped if you try this.

With TotalSpaces2, you can ensure that the two programs you routinely use together, such as a browser for research and a text editor for writing, are adjacent in the grid so that you can rapidly switch between them with a keyboard shortcut or gesture.



Mac Platform: Intel, 64-bit processor OS X 10.9 or later
