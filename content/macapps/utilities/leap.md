Leap is a combination Spotlight, Bridge, Finder, and more. The Finder on OS X is slow, cumbersome, and limited. The Finder search interface is very cumbersome. Leap shows you all your files and more importantly – where they are on your computer. No other tool does this. Works great for images and PDF’s, too. Leap does not force you to put documents in a special place, it uses no databases. Just see whats on your hard drive.

Fully integrated with Mavericks and later, including its tagging system.

Dropbox support. Leap now uses Dropbox if you have it to back up tags.

Dropbox bookmark quickly allows you to search your Dropbox.
