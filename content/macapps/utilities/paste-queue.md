Paste Queue is a great time-saver for copying and pasting multiple items between locations. Just copy all needed items first. Then paste them one by one or all at once — no need to switch back and forth between your source and destination.

For example, you can copy a name, phone number, and address, one by one with a keyboard shortcut, and then paste them all at once (or one by one) in the same order into a form, with another shortcut. It’s like an extended clipboard, where you can copy and paste as many items as you wish each time, in sequential (or reverse) order!

Paste Queue also lets you paste items in a custom order, paste rich text as plain text, rearrange copied items, delete them, etc. If you copy and paste often, it is a right app for you. It’ll make your copy and paste routines simple, fun, and fast!
