Omni Remover is all-in-one package to keep your Mac in fit. It can clean uninstall malicious and stubborn apps, purge 32-bit, orphaned apps leftover and put on-demand storage optimization on macOS Catalina.



Features:
Mac Clean – the new Omni Remover comes to offer a wealth of Mac cleaning tools that were beautifully designed to clean unneeded files, like outdated caches, broken downloads, logs, and useless localizations.

Mac App Uninstall – the core purpose of Omni Remover is to clean a collection of no-longer-needed files that are left behind when you uninstall an app on Mac. Omni Remover can keep track of those files, so the application could get removed completely.

App Force Uninstall – uninstalling Mac apps is simple since most apps are self-contained that don’t mess with the Mac system. But it’s another story if you have ‘stubborn’ apps. Probably you’ll find them again in future even when you think you’ve sent them away. Omni Remover would be your best helper for its simple operation and powerful Mac application removal ability.



Compatibility: macOS 10.9 or later 64-bit
