AirBuddy brings the same AirPods experience you have on iOS to the Mac. With AirBuddy, you can open up your AirPods case next to your Mac and see the status right away, just like it is on your iPhone or iPad. A simple click and you’re connected and playing your Mac’s audio to AirPods.

Oh, it also makes sure the audio input of your Mac is NOT switched to the AirPods automatically when connecting so you can get the best possible quality.
With the Batteries Notification Center widget, you can also see the battery status for your Mac, including how much battery time you have left or how long it’ll take to finish charging (if it’s charging). The widget also shows the battery status for your AirPods, their charging case, other W1 headsets like Beats headphones and your iOS devices.

– Adds support for Powerbeats Pro

– Adds support for the new AirPods with wireless charging case

– The app now shows the correct indicator LED color for the wireless charging case: green when charged, amber when charging or below 30%

– Improves support for other headsets such as Beats Studio

– Adds support for displaying the battery status for Magic Mouse, Magic Keyboard and similar Apple devices in the Batteries widget

– Adds an option to not show the proximity user interface when the nearby device is not paired, this is especially useful in environments with many people
using W1 /H1 devices

– Adds an option (on by default) to not show the status window when the Mac is in Do Not Disturb mode

– Improves the overall reliability when detecting whether nearby AirPods have their charging case opened or closed

– Improves the speed at which the Batteries widget updates information about the devices

– Improves the proximity filtering so devices that are too far away from the Mac don’t make the status window appear

– Improves the speed of the status window animation

– Improves the accessibility of the status window for VoiceOver users

– Adds a new global keyboard shortcut option to show the status window manually for the latest nearby device found (experimental)

– Fixes an issue that caused the icon for AirPods and some Beats products to not appear on macOS 10.14.4

– Fixes an issue that caused the icon for iPhone XR to not appear in the Batteries widget

– Fixes an issue that could cause the helper app to not be started automatically after install, causing the app not to work

– Fixes an issue that would break the layout of the status window when a device had a really long name

– Fixes an issue that would cause the battery percentage to be slightly clipped when at 100%

– Fixes some crashes of MobileDeviceXPC and AirBuddyHelper

– Removes unnecessary menu items from the settings app

– Fixes an issue that would cause devices with different colors to be presented with the same color in the UI

– Improves reliability of updating the status for mobile devices (iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches)

– Fixes a visual glitch in the Batteries widget when expanding

– Fixes an issue that would cause a long device name to break the layout in the Batteries widget

– Fixes an issue that could cause the animation to not be shown for the new AirPods
