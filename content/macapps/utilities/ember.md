Ember is your digital scrapbook of things that inspire you – be it websites, photos, apps or other things. Just drag in images that you want to keep, organise them into relevant collections, annotate the images you need to give feedback on, and share your images to your favourite web services. Ember is built exclusively for the Mac for creatives like you, and we’re just getting started. We hope you enjoy it.



• Support for all your favourite file types

Ember helps you organise your entire creative life, with support for JPEG, PNG, GIF, PSD, PDF, Adobe Illustrator, SVG, QuickTime Video, Plain Text, and Markdown files.

• Organise your ideas and design inspiration

Drag in images from your Mac and around the web, and organise them into Collections. Apply tags to images, and build Smart Collections based on the tags and other metadata in your library.

• Subscribe to your favourite websites

Subscriptions allow you to visually browse the web. Images can be saved to your Ember library, and shared with friends and co-workers.

• Build a scrapbook of designs you love

Save websites to your Ember library from Safari and Chrome with the powerful browser extensions. Ember doesn’t need to be running*, and you can send images to collections right from your browser. Ember uses the width of your browser window when snapping, meaning that the layout is exactly the same in the captured image.

Ember also features a responsive browser, allowing you to save responsive webpages at any desired width, and the Element Selection mode detects appropriate areas of the webpage to snap as you roll over them. There’s even handy presets for your favourite iOS devices to quickly set the browser width.

• Colours

Use natural language (for example, “Light Blue”) to search your library, and find matching images. You can even use Colours as rules in Ember’s powerful Smart Collections – for example, group all your five-star rated white Interior Designs together.

• Sync with iCloud or Dropbox

Store your Ember library in iCloud or Dropbox, and sync it across any Mac.

• Take Screenshots

Take screenshots with Ember, and they’ll automatically appear in your library with the name of the app applied to them. You can capture Fullscreen, Timed Fullscreen, Area and “Window” images.

• Sketch feedback on your images

Beautiful drawing and text tools allow you to give feedback on images. Cropping and rotation ensure that your images are always perfectly sized and aligned.

• Go Full Screen

Work undistracted with Ember in its own space.
