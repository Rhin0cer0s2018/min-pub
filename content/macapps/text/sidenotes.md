SideNotes keeps you from juggling with windows when searching for notes. The app always appears on top of other windows – you can easily hide it or pull it out from the side of your monitor with one click or with a keyboard shortcut. You can even use just your keyboard to work with your notes. Everything is in its place and you still have place for everything.

With SideNotes you can:

smoothly pull out your notes from outside your monitor and easily hide them back

mark notes with colors and group them into folders

drag and drop pictures directly from your web browser

save links, code snippets or even colors

create task lists and mark items done

create notes directly from the pasteboard

drop text files or folders

use 3 text formatting modes: Markdown, Plain Text and Code.

What’s New:

Version 1.2.1

Quick fix: changing backup location for the first time didn’t work until app is restarted.

From 1.2 release:

This release was focused on automatic backups. Now, if you delete any note or folder accidentally, you can try to restore it using previous backup. New version also brings other improvements. Here is a full list of changes:

backups

new app icon

spell checking

UI improvements

cmd+click a file preview to reveal file in Finder

clicking a rendered color saves it in the Pasteboard

Preferences: an option to enter a folder with return key

Preferences: setting line height

Improved performance of long notes

Removing indention or task if a user pressed return 2 times

Enhanced drag and drop into text

Adding space after a dropping link

FIXED: some users experienced an issue that application didn’t allow to enter any text

FIXED: moving note should go on top

FIXED: checkmark was barely visible

FIXED: it was possible to enter full screen with keyboard shortcuts

FIXED: modifying checkmark didn’t save changed immediately

Compatibility: OS X 10.14 or later 64-bit
