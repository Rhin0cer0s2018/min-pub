What’s New in TextSoap 8

Just a glimpse of the improvements offered

Fresh Interface
TextSoap has a fresh, new interface. We stripped off all the “chrome” to focus on your content, whether you are working with text, or building custom cleaners.

Improved Text Editor

TextSoap focuses on processing text, but sometimes you need a text editor too. It includes great new options like showing line numbers and being able to toggle wrapping of lines.

Built-in Cleaners

TextSoap offers up a large collection of more than 100 built-in cleaners. These cleaners can address your text issue completely, or serve as building blocks for a customized text processing solution.

Live Text Matching

Live text matching is great for trying out regular expressions. As you type in a valid expression, it shows you all the matches in your text. See exactly how matches come up.

Expanded Import/Export

Sharing cleaners means it is easier to create solutions for others, or use solutions others have created. New library files allow exporting multiple cleaners within a single file.

New Custom Cleaner Editor

Sometimes your specific text problem requires customize solution. The powerful new custom cleaner editor comes to the rescue, all with a simple drag-n-drop approach.

Color Coded Actions

Color coded actions make it easy to look at a custom cleaner definition and understand which actions are doing what.

Regex Syntax Highlighting

Regular Expressions are a powerful way to find text. The new syntax highlighting helps you understand those expressions better. And the new expression validator makes it easier than ever to spot any potential errors.

Version 8.6:

Improved support for macOS 11 (Big Sur).

Compatibility: OS X 10.10 or later 64-bit
