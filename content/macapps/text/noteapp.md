NoteApp is a text editor for people who need something really simple yet beautiful. It works with plain text (TXT) files. It does not support any text formatting. The application supports light and dark modes. It looks fantastic in full-screen and split-view modes. NoteApp does not support markdown, and we’re not going to change it. It’s an incredibly simple app.
