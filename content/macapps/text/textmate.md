TextMate is a versatile plain text editor with a unique and innovative feature set which caused it to win an Apple Design Award for Best Mac OS X Developer Tool in August 2006.

A rapidly growing community have created modes for more than a hundred different “modes” including support for all major programming languages, writing prose in structured formats such as LaTeX, Markdown, Textile, etc., blogging, running SQL queries, writing screen plays, doing your budget, and much much more.

Multiple Carets

Making multiple changes at once, swapping pieces of code, and a lot more is made trivial with TextMate’s easy way to add multiple insertion points.

File Search

Select what you want to search, what you want to search for, and TextMate will present the results in a way that makes it easy to jump between matches, extract matched text, or preview desired replacements.

Version Control

See what files have changes in the file browser view, what lines have changes in the editor view, bring up a diff of the current file’s changes, commit a subset, TextMate supports it all for all the major version control systems.

Scoped Settings

One file mixing languages? Projects using different build systems? Third party code with different formatting preferences? TextMate can handle it all by associating detailed scope selectors with key shortcuts, settings, etc.

Commands

The UNIX underpinnings of macOS allows custom actions to be written in any language that can work with stdin, stdout, and environment variables, and for complex interactions TextMate expose both WebKit and a dialog framework for Mac-native or HTML-based interfaces.

Snippets

Commonly used pieces of text or code can be turned into snippets with placeholders, transformations, and more, to have them adapt according to the context in which they are used.

Bundles

TextMate uses bundles for customization and supports a countless number of different languages, markup systems, workflows, and more.

Macros

Repetitive work can be eliminated with macros. Either save them for repeated use or record a scratch macro for immediate replay.

And More…

Clipboard history, custom themes, live HTML/Markdown preview, foldable code blocks, indented soft wrap, etc.

Compatibility: macOS 10.8 or later, 64-bit processor
