OmmWriter A wise man once said: “We are all at the mercy of our wild monkey minds. Incessantly swinging from branch to branch”. With multiple windows and applications all vying for our attention, we have sadly adapted our working habits to that of the computer and not the other way around.

OmmWriter is a humble attempt to recapture what technology has snatched away from us today: our capacity to concentrate.

OmmWriter is a tool that makes writing a pleasure again, allowing users to be alone with their thoughts; to concentrate and to write without distractions. More than a word processor, OmmWriter is a place to get inspired.

We have spent a considerable amount of research time and effort in the audio-visual experience to promote and enhance creativity.

OmmWriter is the fruit of this investigation with new dynamic backgrounds employing Chroma therapy techniques as well as new sound effects. This version, Gaia, is a reflection of its new soothing sound environments and backgrounds inspired by Earth’s natural landscapes. In particular, the nocturnal background, which relaxes your vision (and probably your mood).
