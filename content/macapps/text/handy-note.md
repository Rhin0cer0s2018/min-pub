Handy Note is a finely crafted sticky note app that allows you to quickly jot down important information and keep it easily visible on your screen.

Virtual Stickies on your Mac

Handy Note is a finely crafted sticky note app that allows you to quickly jot down important information and keep it easily visible on your screen.

Search with Hashtags

Writing sticky notes is addictive, but even if you have several dozen notes, it’s still easy to find what you’re looking for with Handy Note’s hashtags search and filtering support.

Simple & Flexible

We hate needlessly complex apps. Handy Note works like TextEdit, but has a layer of beauty and refinement that means you’ll never want to use anything else for quick note taking.

Ultimate Control

You can collapse, resize and rearrange notes to create a completely unique layout on your Mac.
Also, collapsing notes allows you to hide certain notes from prying eyes and helps keep your screen from getting too cluttered.

Create Beautiful Note Themes

Not only does Handy Note have a great selection of sticky note themes, but it also allows you to express your own creativity and produce totally unique themes to suit your preferences. For an added level of customisation, you can also control the opacity of individual notes!

Compatibility: OS X 10.10 or later 64-bit
