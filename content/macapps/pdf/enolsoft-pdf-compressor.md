Enolsoft PDF Compressor Reduce PDF Size on Mac by One Click. No need to enlarge your device’s storage. Upload and share PDF files easily. Avoid splitting large PDFs to store. No impact content, not effect images resolutions and no change file layout. They are the conditions for us to reduce PDF file size.

After reduced PDF files size, the storage requirements will automatically go down. Then you can store more files easier! In general, when we get the hint that our drive’s storage is not enough, we usually choose to delete useless files or enlarge our drive storages.

With PDF compressor, you cloud set the size you want to compress depends on your requirement. (Including custom size, large size, medium size, small size and minimal size.)

Most PDFs are larger than you expect, it may because files with a very large amount of content, such as vector, raster image content, and embedded full fonts.

In fact, images used in PDF files are often larger than necessary, and no need to embed full fonts etc. PDF compressor for Mac reduces the file size at the condition of keeping same quality as original files through delete unnecessary element, compress images without effecting resolution etc.
