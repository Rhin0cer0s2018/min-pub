Movavi PDF Editor Looking for a PDF reader for Mac with good editing tools? Most of the software for Mac that you can find online for download is not that great. Free desktop apps usually lack advanced options and have inadequate formatting tools, and higher-quality paid programs can be out of the question because of their high price. We decided to combine the best features of the available OS X PDF editors without the drawbacks to come up with a Mac PDF Editor youâ€™ll like. Create and update contract drafts, combine multiple scans into PDF files, and much more!

Compatibility: OS X 10.7 or later, 64-bit processor
