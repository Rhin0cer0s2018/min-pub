Wipr blocks all ads, trackers, cryptocurrency miners, EU cookie and GDPR notices, and other annoyances, so you can focus on the content that matters to you while using Safari.

Features

Time, Data, and Battery Saver

Web pages load a lot faster with Wipr, and much less needs to be downloaded. Your battery will love this.

Private

Wipr prevents countless trackers from invading your privacy. Wipr itself cannot, nor wants to, know what you do on the web.

Fast

By using a new technology called Content Blocking Extensions, Wipr can do its job without slowing down Safari at all.

Up-to-date

Wipr’s blocklist is updated twice a week to keep up with the ever-changing web.

Honest

No one can pay to unblock ads. There are no “acceptable ads”. Wipr only answers to you.

Global

Wipr will use an enhanced blocklist for German, Italian, French, Czech, Slovak, Polish, Dutch, Russian and Spanish speakers.

Smart

You can set up Wipr in seconds, and it will update automatically in the background to block future annoyances. There is no configuration.

This app was built with love and patience. I hope you’ll enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed designing and building it.

Wipr is also available for your iPhone or iPad, look for it in the App Store!

Enjoy a cleaner web!
