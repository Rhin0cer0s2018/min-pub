Data Guardian designed to help you protect accounts details, passwords, and more using the 448-bits Blowfish encryption algorithm

Using singular passkeys for different accounts is the least you can do when it comes to staying safe: this way, even if one of your accounts is compromised, the others remain safe. However, memorizing all that information can prove to be rather challenging.

Data Guardian is a macOS application that enables you to quickly create a database that contains the credentials for all your accounts. To keep everything safe, you can protect the database with a master password, while Data Guardian will encrypt it by using the powerful  448-bits Blowfish algorithm.


## Provides support for multiple databases

To get stated with Data Guardian, you must first create a database and then populate it with details about various types of accounts. The application is also able to store data about products licenses, contacts, notes, and even recipes.

The best part is that you can create as many databases as you like: this way, the application can be used by multiple users at the same time. Moreover, you can sync the database to other devices, and have access to your credentials at all times.

## Helps you generate reliable passwords

In addition, Data Guardian comes with a password generator that is able to create random passkeys in no time. Note that the template for the random password can be easily changed via the Preferences window

On top of that, the built in Password Assistant enables you make personalized passwords. First off, you get to select the password type: memorable, letters&numbers, numbers only, random, or FIPS-181 compliant. The next step is to select the password length from a slider bar: depending on the result, Data Guardian lets you know the quality level of the currently generated password.

## Straightforward password management utility with powerful encryption capabilities

Data Guardian offers you the possibility to store your passwords and other type of data in a clean and organized environments. Moreover, you get to protect the database with a master password and use the Blowfish encryption algorithm.
