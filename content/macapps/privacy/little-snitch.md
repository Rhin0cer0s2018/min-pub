Little Snitch A powerful and versatile application that enables you to monitor the network traffic and intercept unwanted connection attempts.

Track background activity As soon as your computer connects to the Internet, applications often have permission to send any information wherever they need to. Little Snitch takes note of this activity and allows you to decide for yourself what happens with this data.

Control your network Choose to allow or deny connections, or define a rule how to handle similar, future connection attempts. Little Snitch runs inconspicuously in the background and it can even detect network-related activity of viruses, trojans, and other malware.

Filter connections and monitor your network traffic with ease The Little Snitch Network Monitor utility features a well-designed interface and provide easy-to-read animated and informative diagrams created based on real time traffic information. Hence, you can analyze bandwidth, connectivity status, traffic totals, detailed traffic history for the past hour and more. You can filter the displayed data based on the process name or server port and group them according to your needs. Little Snitch helps you view traffic peaks, check the average bandwidth and save snapshots for further analysis.

Enable the Silent Mode for a distraction free working environment The network traffic can be easily captured in the PCAP format while the network activity is displayed along various system events in order to provide a context. There is also a Silent Mode that allows you to get on with your work without being interrupted by any network related notifications. However, you can review the Silent Mode Log to create rules for connection attempts that took place during this period. On top of that, you can group your rules in different profiles and enable them only when a particular profile is active. Thanks to Little Snitch’s status bar menu, you can choose the desired profile with just a few mouse clicks.

Enjoy the versatility of the Automatic Profile Switching function At the same time, you can take advantage of the Automatic Profile Switching feature and associate different networks with certain profiles. Once the network is detected, the associate profile is automatically enabled. For example, you can use a set of filters when you are at home and more restrictive ruleset when you access the web from an Internet Cafe. What is more, Little Snitch features a flexible temporary rule system that offers a number of options for rules that are effective only for a limited period of time. Furthermore, Little Snitch automatically analyzes your ruleset and indicates the presence of overlapping, redundant or invalid rules that you might want to delete.

Requirements: Intel, 64-bit processor OS X 10.10 or later
