Browserosaurus is The browser prompter for macOS

Multi-Default

After clicking a link, use the picker to choose the correct browser for the job.



Favourite

Quickly open your usual browser using the SPACE key.


URL Bar

Make sure the website you are about to open is the one you are expecting.

Browserosaurus is FREE. However, please consider sponsorship. Doing so will help me cover the cost of future development and the fee charged by Apple to release software on their operating system.

Why does Browserosaurus ask to be set as my default browser?

This is required for Browserosaurus to know that a link has been clicked. You can change this at any time by going to System Preferences > General > Default web browser and (de)selecting Browserosaurus.

How do I set my favourite browser?

A favourite browser will open when the SPACE key is pressed, and is therefore an easier target to hit. You can set your favourite by using the ⭐️ menu.

I would like to open a particular browser automatically for specific URLs.

Browserosaurus does not provide a method for automatically selecting browsers, rather opting for the consistency that the picker window will show every time. If you would like to be able set rules, I highly recommend Finicky by John Sterling which can very easily be used in tandem with Browserosaurus, meaning the best of both worlds: a rules engine and a graphical interface.

The picker window is very slow to display.

The app needs to be running in the background for the picker window to show immediately. You can confirm Browserosaurus is running by looking for the "B" icon in the menubar. If Browserosaurus is not currently running, it can take a few seconds until it is available. Each subsequently clicked link will open the picker window promptly.

I'm clicking links in my browser but Browserosaurus does not show.

Only links clicked outside of browsers will open Browserosaurus. This is by design.

Does Browserosaurus collect any of my data and send it to an online service?
No.

Not even the link I click?

Nope. The only outgoing call Browserosaurus makes is to check for an update.

I installed or removed a browser but I'm not seeing this updated in the picker window.
Browserosaurus checks for installed browsers when it is first opened. Clicking the reload button (bottom-right) will reload the app, triggering a new scan for installed browsers.

I have a browser that's not shown in the picker window, even after reloading Browserosaurus.
Browserosaurus operates on a whitelist basis. If you would like a browser added, please raise an issue.

Why/how is this free?

Browserosaurus has by far been the most enjoyable project I've ever created and this comes from the fact that I use it every day. Being a fan of open source software, I thought I'd share it with the world. But just because it's free for you does not mean it is free to make. Personal time aside, Apple charges a yearly subscription that I must pay for the app to work correctly on your machine. If you love Browserosaurus as much as I do, please consider sponsoring its future development. Thank you.

I have a question that is not answered here.

If you have any issues or feature requests please raise an issue on the GitHub repository.
