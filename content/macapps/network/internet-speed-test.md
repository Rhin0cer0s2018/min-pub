“Internet Speed test” has a unique algorithm that cannot be tricked by PowerBoost or similar speed enhancement tools. So, the results you achieved will be accurate as per your system data speed.  “Internet Speed test” is a single threaded test while most others (like speed test dot net) are multi-threaded. It uses a single connection to download the sample files which is closer to what you actually do in your everyday browsing and downloading.

• Test Count: Number of tests done to get accurate results

• Latency Time: A time delay between the cause and the effect of some physical change in the system being observed.

• Jitter Time: The amount of time it takes for a block of information, called a packet, to travel across a network

• Public IP: Your public IP address is the IP address that is logged by various servers/devices when you connect to them through your internet connection.
