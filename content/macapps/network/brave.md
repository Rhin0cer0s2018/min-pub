The new Brave browser blocks ads and trackers that slow you down and invade your privacy. Discover a new way of thinking about how the web can work.

Load pages 3x to 6x faster

Watch Brave in action, head-to-head-to-head against Chrome and Firefox. Brave loads pages three times as fast out of the box with nothing to install, learn or manage.

Import and continue where you left off

It’s easy to import your settings from your old browser. You can do it during the welcome tour or later through the menus.

All of your old browser profiles will appear in a list. You can import other browser data through the main menu item called “Import Bookmarks and Settings.”

Support your favorite sites with Brave Rewards 

Turn on Brave Rewards and give a little back to the sites you frequent most. Earn frequent flyer-like tokens (BAT) for viewing privacy-respecting ads through Brave and help fund the content you love Browsing the web with Brave is free: with Brave Rewards activated, you can support the content creators you love at the amount that works for you.

Experience unparalleled privacy and security. 

Brave fights malware and prevents tracking, keeping your information safe and secure. It’s our top priority. We’re not in the personal data business. Our servers neither see nor store your browsing data – it stays private, on your devices, until you delete it. Which means we won’t ever sell your data to third parties.
Customize your shield settings

Choose your settings on a per-site or browser-wide basis. See how many ads and trackers are being blocked by Brave every day on the New Tab Page.

Interested in trying out early versions of Brave?

New features are typically introduced in the Nightly channel. After we’ve worked out the kinks we move them into the Beta build for a final check before merging them into the Release version of Brave you see here.
