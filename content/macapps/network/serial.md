Serial is a modern terminal designed to make working with servers, network equipment, and embedded hardware easier for engineers and system administrators. Built from scratch for OS X, eliminates the need to search for and install drivers in order to work with most USB to adapters and other serial-port devices. Other powerful features include full terminal emulation so you can use screen-based programs including emacs, vi, or nano, or navigate the menus needed to configure network devices.

For Makers and Engineers

We work with lots of hardware, and we built because we needed something better. makes working with the Arduino, Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, and any other device that uses a port for communication easier from a Mac. Working with a Bluetooth device? supports Bluetooth, too.

For System Administrators

There’s no easier way to connect directly to a router or console port on a server with a Mac. also supports the all-important break sequence required to access special features within Cisco and many other network devices.

No Drivers

Serial includes built-in support for the most common USB to serial devices, often saving you the hassle of of finding and installing additional software. Have a device you can’t get working with your Mac?

Real Terminal Emulation

includes a fully functional terminal emulator, which you’ll need in order to use vi, emacs, or navigate the menu-driven interfaces found in many devices.

No More Guessing

Take the guesswork out of working with serial ports. You just plugged your device in– is it /dev/cu.usbmodemfd133? Or /dev/tty.usbmodemfd133? In , you’ll see the device name, not some cryptic path. For example, you’ll see “BeagleBoneBlack” if you’ve just plugged one in to your Mac.

Built for Macs

We built Serial from scratch, only for the Mac, using the latest Apple technologies. is not a port of an existing application.
