Transfer is a reliable and fully RFC-compliant TFTP server application. The perfect alternative to the built-in TFTP server on your Mac. It’s got everything you expect: real-time updates of current transfers in progress, support for broadcast TFTP requests, transfer history and basic TFTP root directory access control and file management. A feature rich TFTP server with a simple and modern user interface.

Transfer is all you need for your file transfers. Just launch the app and you’re ready to go. Quit the app and the TFTP server goes away to avoid unwanted access to your files by others in your network.

Compatibility: macOS 10.12 or later
