Jetbrains Clion is A power tool for a language of power. Smart Editor C and C ++. Thanks to the native support for C and C ++, including the standard C ++ 11, libc ++ and Boost, CLION knows your code from start to finish and handles routine while you focus on the important things.

Generation code

Add class members, functions override / implementation, set a code block with an instruction or generates a statement from actual use, all using simple keyboard shortcuts.

Refactoring

Rename symbols, members move up or down in the hierarchy, change the function signature and ensure that automated refactorings CLION accurately 
propagate appropriate throughout your code changes.

Analysis of code on the fly

With CLION, you can create a code that is beautiful and right at the same time. Potential problems are identified code instantly …

… and arranged as you type! Make sure CLION manage all the right changes.

CLION also performs data flow analysis to uncover all cases of unreachable code, infinite recursion and more.

Integrated debugger

Research and resolve problems easily through the user friendly interface with GDB debugger CLION or LLDB (OS X) available as back-end.

Online Variable View

Get the full view of your project with variable values shown in the editor as debugged.

View clocks and variables

Inspect the condition of the entire variable for a function selected in the stack frame, or monitor variable changes / expression during the debugging session.

CMake

Using CMake as a model project, CLION handles changes in CMake files automatically, using all the information from there during editing and refactoring code.

The full experience

The popular VCS factory supported include Subversion, Git, GitHub, Mercurial, CVS, Perforce (via a plugin) and TFS.

CLION also seamlessly integrates with Google test framework.

Embedded terminal

Run any command without leaving the IDE: locally or remotely using the SSH protocol. Depending on your platform, you can work with a command line 
prompt, Far, powershell, bash or other tools.

Centric approach keyboard

To help you focus on the code and increase productivity, CLION has keyboard shortcuts for almost all its features, actions and commands.
