Paw HTTP Client The most advanced API tool for Mac. Paw is a full-featured HTTP client that lets you test and describe the APIs you build or consume. It has a beautiful native macOS interface to compose requests, inspect server responses, generate client code and export API definitions.



A full-featured HTTP Client

Building great software is hard, and developer tools should be helping you without the headaches. Paw is exclusively built for macOS, so you should easily get the hang of it. Every feature is built intuitively with quick mouse or keyboard shortcut access.



Describe your APIs

Visually build your API requests and describe each parameter through textual descriptions, typing, and constraints. Paw natively supports JSON Schema and can import and generate fully compliant Swagger, RAML, and API Blueprint description files.



Paw for Teams

Keep everyone in sync with Paw for Teams. Create a team, invite your team and everyone gets seamlessly the updates. And because we know how important it is to keep your work safe, everyone can work on a separate branch and merge changes only when ready; itâ€™s almost as powerful as Git and as smooth as real-time sync.





Compatibility: OS X 10.10 or later 64-bit
