Depth knowledge of your code. IntelliJ IDEA analyzes your code, looking for connections between symbols among all project files and languages. Using this information provides help coding depth, quick navigation, intelligent analysis of errors and, of course, refactorings.

Depth knowledge of your code. IntelliJ IDEA analyzes your code, looking for connections between symbols among all project files and languages. Using this information provides help coding depth, quick navigation, intelligent analysis of errors and, of course, refactorings.

intelligent conclusion

Ctrl + Shift + Space gives you a list of the most important symbols applicable in the present context. This and other terminations are constantly learning from you, moving members of classes and packages most frequently used at the top of the list of suggestions, so you can select them faster.

Duplicate Detection

Find duplicate code snippets on the fly. Even if you are just about to remove a variable, constant or method, IntelliJ IDEA will let you know that there is a similar code fragment that can be replaced with is woking on.

Inspections and quick fixes

IntelliJ IDEA whenever it detects that you are about to make a mistake, a small light bulb appears in the editor. When you click on it or press Alt + Enter a list of actions you can take to make things right opens.

Integrated development tools

to streamline your workflow, IntelliJ IDEA provides a set of tools unbeatable since the first start: decompiler, bytecode viewer, FTP and many more.
Polyglot experience

In addition to Java, IntelliJ IDEA provides first – class support frameworks and languages for JVM and non – JVM first class.
