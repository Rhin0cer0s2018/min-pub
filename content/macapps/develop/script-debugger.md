Script Debugger provides everything you need to quickly and easily author AppleScripts that work. No other scripting tool can match Script Debugger’s capabilities for creating, editing and debugging AppleScripts. Its sophisticated Dictionary browser provides far more information than any other tool can and eliminates guesswork and needless experimentation. Simply put, Script Debugger makes AppleScript easy.

We also appreciate the ability to allow AppleScript to automate time – consuming tasks that are repetitive. But like entering a maze at night, using AppleScript requires guesswork and a lot of feeling in the dark. Script Debugger turn on the light switch so you can see what’s in front of you. It gives you more than just a flashlight, it gives natural light.

**What is Script Debugger?**

Script Debugger is an integrated development environment completely focused on AppleScript. This approach allows Script Debugger offer a set of tools that make the development of AppleScript is incredibly productive. Features like browser dictionaries let you look directly into the interface scripts live any application and step debugging with the ability to view the status of all variables for AppleScript can be used in a way that never before you have experienced. Of course, this is just a sample of the things that makes Script Debugger.

**To explore**

AppleScript success depends on understanding the applications you want to automate. Dictionary window Script Debugger is where you find information and commands offered by applications. But that’s just the starting point. Explorer is the place where you can experiment with the application, where you can explore the data provided and manipulate data to see how the application responds.

Explorers power does not disappear when you leave the dictionary. As you go to edit your script, follow and are available as you create and debug your script to display information in which it is operating.

**Edit**

Once you have figured out how to exploit the capabilities of an application, you are ready to write scripts. Maximize productivity and write scripts easily and quickly with the powerful, flexible features building codes Script Debugger way. Insert blocks for applications and tell objects or properties. The functions of “cuts” and replacing scripts Script Debugger intelligently insert codes ranging from AppleScript constructs (such as repeat loops) to basic blocks of instructions to command application (including parameters). Improved features specifically for the peculiarities of the AppleScript language allow you to easily navigate large command sequences automatically enter lines “final”

**Debugging**

As you create a script, you must try to ensure that it behaves as expected. The first step is to run the script. If an error stops the script, Script Debugger track of all the variables and their values to that point, which facilitates the discovery of what went wrong. Script Debugger presents a complete picture of what is happening as the script runs.

Explorers always present seem to continually show any value in great detail. If the value becomes a reference to a song in iTunes, for example, not only it gives it its name, but also lets you explore the attributes of the song.

Use one step to see the script while, line by line, runs seeing the values of all variables at each stage of the execution of the script. Use breakpoints to pause your code at key points. You can even create breakpoints that trap conditions in your code. You never have to add another AppleScript registration statement just to see where you are and what is the value of an important variable. With Script Debugger, your code works by design, not by guesswork.

To deploy

After developing a script, you must package it for your client, workgroup or whoever uses it . Script Debugger jumps at this point to look for common errors when packaging scripts. Tools and versioning control code Script Debugger 6 Always make the distribution of scripts to others is incredibly simple. If your script contains confidential or proprietary information, you can export the Run form only to prevent others from accessing the code. The only Manifesto Script Debugger tells you instantly what applications, additions scripts, libraries and frameworks are needed to run your script successfully.

Compatibility: OS X 10.10 or later 64-bit
