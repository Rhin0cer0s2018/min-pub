New Features:

License Deregistration

Users can now deregister a license from a computer and install that same license on a new computer and continue using it.

Shelving of Binary Files

Allows users to temporarily "shelve" (set aside) in-process changes and revert back to the working tree - to quickly fix a bug on production, for example. Once done, users can simply retrieve their shelved changes and continue where they left off. This feature was released in Cornerstone 4.0 for non-binary files only and now can be used for binary files as well.

App Store - Users can now purchase annual Cornerstone subscriptions form the Apple App Store.

License Verification

The application will attempt to verify subscription status more than once on startup if the Internet is not connected yet.
