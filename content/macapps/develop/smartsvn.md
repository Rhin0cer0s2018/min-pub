SmartSVN supports the Subversion working copy format and client-server protocol and virtually all Subversion commands, including many extended options.

Tag and Branch Support (SmartSVN Professional)

With SmartSVN Professional you can work with tags and branches as conveniently as if they were native Subversion features. Once you have defined the project repository locations for the trunk, the tags and branches, you won't have to deal with hard-to-remember URLs anymore: Just use tags and branches the way you're used to from other version control systems.

For example, when you need to switch to a different branch or tag, you won't have to type the branch or tag name. but Instead, you can simply select it from a Tag Browser that displays branches and tags in their hierarchical order.

Incoming and Outgoing Change Markers

In the project directory view you can instantly see which directories contain local modifications (red arrows) and which directories have been changed in the repository (green arrows, SmartSVN Professional).

In combination with the Remote State of the files (SmartSVN Professional) you can detect and avoid potential conflicts before they actually occur. SmartSVN Professional even shows files and directories which have been added to the repository and aren't locally available yet.

Revision Graph (SmartSVN Professional)

The Revision Graph shows the hierarchical history of a file or directory. It provides operations similar to those of the Log command, such as comparing two revisions of a certain file, but surpasses the Log command in presentation and level of detail. Also, the Revision Graph can show upon request which revisions have been merged, have been merged in the selected revision, or haven't been merged yet.

From the Revision Graph you can instantly see:

which changes happened in which branch,

which revision represents which tag,

when a file was moved, renamed or copied along with its history.
