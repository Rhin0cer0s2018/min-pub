PlistEdit Pro is the most advanced property list and JSON editor written for macOS.

Mac and iOS developers must edit a variety of property list and JSON files while developing their applications. PlistEdit Pro makes editing these files easier by providing an intutive and powerful interface. In addition to being able to copy and paste or drag and drop property list data around, PlistEdit Pro also offers powerful find and replace functionality, as well as structure definitions which provide easy access to commonly used keys in various standard property list files.

Power users can also benefit from PlistEdit Proâ€™s preferences browser, which allows easy access to property lists used by macOS to store settings on your system. Browse through your preferences, or search an entire folder of plist files at once for a particular key or value. PlistEdit Pro also enables automation of tasks involving property lists, via its Applescript support and its pledit command line tool.
