new features

The all – new tower

Best Git client with many new features like Pull Requests, Interactive rebasing and Quick Actions.

Extraction applications

Create, fuses, closes said extraction and inspects applications directly from Tower! Integrated into our interface clear, responsive and powerful desktop
applications extraction become much more useful.

Quick Actions

The new Quick Actions dialog gives you superpowers: give it a name branch and will offer a way out. Give a file name and present the history file. Give confirmation
hash and display it on the record confirmation. Quick as a flash, easy as pie.

interactive rebase

Interactive rebasing is an incredibly powerful tool, but also rather unpleasant to use. But now, in Tower, it has become as easy as drag and drop!

Navigation

We have added many new levels of detail in the new tower. And while surfing Tower is now as simple as surfing the web: the new buttons “back” and “forward” and
“Navigation bar” improved.

Confirm details

have redesigned many areas in the new tower. Take for example the new view “Confirm details” with all updates to the left and plenty of space for the difference right, you can inspect and review confirmation in a more focused manner.

reflog

A little known feature, but with enormous power: reflog can restore lost commits or branches, reverted back to a state, break a pick-up or commit … and is now
available in Tower!

Image Diffing

Tower is much more than just code. An example is the new feature “Blurring image” see exactly how they have changed their PNG, JPG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, JPEG2000 and HEIC files, just inside Tower.

File fault history and

have redesigned the views “File History” and “blame” from scratch. They have become much more useful and informative. Try it yourself!

Search for

The search functionality in the new tower has become much more powerful. You can now search files almost anywhere: in the working copy, in a historical file tree,
or even within the set of changes confirmation.
