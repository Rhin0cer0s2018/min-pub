Timey 3has been redesigned and rebuilt from the ground up with these key areas in mind:

Ease of use – Timey’s UI has been reimagined to be more straightforward. Using important features like time changing, timer presets and stopwatch is now easier then ever.

Menu bar space saving – the app now takes less of your precious screen space. The menu button automatically hides and there is an all-new mini mode available.

Presets (previously Quick Timers) – presets are now the core part of the app. Using and managing them has been brought to the front and you are now able to quickly access them using global keyboard shortcuts.

What’s New:


Version 3.3.5:

Minor tweaks and fixes, new icon.

Compatibility: macOS 10.13 or later, 64-bit processor
