Memoires is the best way to keep your journal on OS X. Choose a day and write as many notes as you like. Then browse your journal by day using calendar, or search for notes using the instant-search feature.

Memoires has a gorgeous user interface. Even though it’s a powerful application, it is very easy to use. No distractions, no complicated forms: just two buttons and one search field. Even easier than a paper journal!

Memoires supports AES-256 encryption, so your diaries will be safe from prying eyes.

What’s New:

Added exact searches (surround your whole search query with quote marks to search for the exact phrase). Previous version introduced improved search by splitting quieries into words. Some users wanted the exact search back, so in this release we introduced it back: for example, to search for why me, but not for why not me, type “why me”, including quotes.

Fixed black sidebar background in Yosemite if “Reduce transparency” accessibility setting was on.

Compatibility: OS X 10.10 or later 64-bit
