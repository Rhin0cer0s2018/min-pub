Klokki is a rule-based time-tracking that will start/pause the timer for you automatically. The automation is based on the rules you configure and that gives you full control over what should be tracked and what not.

Features:

Auto-Tracking: The Auto-Tracking technology automatically tracks the time for you, based on what you tell it to track. This way you keep the control over it, but the need to manually start or pause the timer goes completely away.

Traditional time-tracking: Use the traditional start/pause buttons, for manual control over your session.


What’s New:

Version 1.1.3:

Improvements

Overnight sessions: This improvement is for us — the night owls. You are now able to track sessions that go beyond the current day, without any issues.

New shortcuts generator: A needed adjustment we had to make, to ensure a more flexible future development. INFO: you would need to recreate your previously generated shortcuts.

Performance: The Timer-window should now run a bit smoother.

Fixed

The decimal symbol.

Summary calculations.
