Alarm Clock Pro isn’t just an ordinary alarm clock. Use it to wake you up in the morning, send and compose e-mails, remind you of appointments, randomize the iTunes selection, control an internet radio station, and even time your baking!

Wake up to the serenity of your musical selection. Put to rest the goofy retro beeps and buzzing of a bedside alarm clock or cell phone. Use Alarm Clock Pro when waking up, as a reminder to take medications, or keep social appointments. At work, schedule follow up appointments with clients, set break reminders, run the office radio, set project timers, or discreetly monitor employee workspaces.
