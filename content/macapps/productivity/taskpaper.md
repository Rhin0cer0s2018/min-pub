TaskPaper is a plain-text to-do list that’s surprisingly adept. Thoroughly modernized. TaskPaper 3 is all new, while still retaining the same plain-text design that’s been getting things done since 2006.



Text editor with outlining power. TaskPaper feels like a plain text editor, but it is backed by a powerful outliner.

Plain text

Keyboard friendly. Type your lists into TaskPaper and each line is formatted into a project, task, or note.

No locks

TaskPaper files are future proof. Edit them in any text editor or use one of the many compatible apps created by other developers.

Outliner power

Fold, focus, and filter to cut big lists down to size. Use saved searches to quickly filter the items in your lists.

No limits

TaskPaper doesn’t force a particular system on you; it provides basic list elements to use as you see fit. Go beyond with scripts and themes.
