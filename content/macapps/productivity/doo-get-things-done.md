Doo lets you turn your reminders into cards that help you focus and teach you better habits. Work small to achieve big.

It’s easy to procrastinate your to-do list without a clear first step. Tasks with large goals can feel impossible to finish.

Doo helps you procrastinate less. Your reminders become cards that are easy to start and easy to finish. The streamlined edit screen encourages you to create tasks that can fit on a digital index card. Each card shows up in a stack — instead of a list — so you can focus on one thing at a time.

FEATURE HIGHLIGHTS

• Improve your focus with a unique, card-based interface

• Create open-ended, date-based, or location-based reminders

• Stay engaged with a delightful user experience

• Collaborate on tasks with other Doo users (requires iCloud)

• Create checklists that stay out of your way until you need them

• Get repeating alerts if you ignore any notifications

• Schedule tasks with custom intervals and early alerts

• Toggle notifications on a per-reminder basis

• Sync with iCloud across iOS and Mac devices

• Set your preferred morning and evening hours for smarter scheduling and snooze

• Create to-dos from within other apps using the share extension


• Sort your cards from the list view to speed through your day

• Customize your default snooze duration

• Enjoy Doo with full accessibility support, including VoiceOver and keyboard shortcuts

• Run Doo from the dock or menu bar

Get Doo and get things done!
