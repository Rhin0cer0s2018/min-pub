NeoOffice is an office suite for Mac that is based on OpenOffice and LibreOffice. With NeoOffice, you can view, edit, and save OpenOffice documents, LibreOffice documents, and simple Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents.

Two engineers created in 2003 when they made OpenOffice run natively on OS X for the first time. Since then, the engineers have continually added improvements to that you will not find in
OpenOffice or LibreOffice such as:

NeoOffice > Open at Launch menu to open Calc or Impress instead of Writer at launch

File > Browse All Versions menu to restore previous versions of your documents

Native file locking to safely edit files in iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or network drives

Native Mac grammar checking

Native Mac text highlighting

Support for Mac Services

Native floating tool windows
