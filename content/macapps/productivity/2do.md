2Do lets you take a completely different approach to managing your tasks. With its extremely simple-to-use interface and a comprehensive and flexible set of powerful features, it lets you focus on what’s most important to you: your life. There is no wrong way of using 2Do, and unlike other to-do apps, it won’t force you in adhering to a particular task management methodology.

SIMPLE TASKS, CHECKLISTS & PROJECTS


Create simple tasks, or checklists and projects with sub-tasks. Tasks can have notes, attachments and multiple alarms.

Set any task to repeat using a flexible set of options.

LIST GROUPS, LISTS & SMART LISTS



In addition to built-in Focus lists that allow you to conveniently view upcoming, starred or scheduled tasks, you can create multiple lists to manage and organize your tasks.

Smart lists let you harness the true potential of 2Do using a number of search options, filters and search pre-sets. Using Smart Lists, you can create custom views of your tasks and
use them to focus-in or find frequently managed tasks.

Furthermore, related Smart lists and Lists can be grouped together using a List Group in the order you desire.

PROJECT VIEW



Quickly focus on your projects and their sub-tasks and nothing else

Access project view directly from the list view or using keyboard shortcuts

Focus filters and sort options can be applied separately to individual projects using Project View

TAGS



Manage tags within Tag Groups.

Easily assign tags to tasks and vice versa.

Leverage the easy to use yet powerful integration of Tags & Smart Lists to filter on frequently managed tasks.

Find Used vs. Unused tags with a click.

LOCATIONS



Easily create, edit and assign locations to tasks

Create powerful Smart Lists based on Locations

SYNC



Stay in sync with multiple Macs and mobile devices running 2Do using your favorite sync method over fast and reliable Push Sync: Dropbox, Reminders (CalDAV), 3rd Party CalDAV
Servers (iCal, Fruux, ownCloud etc) or Toodledo.

Using Dropbox, you can keep multiple devices in sync seamlessly. Devices can be added / removed at any time.

Using Reminders CalDAV sync you can keep 2Do and Reminders in sync as well as create tasks using Siri.

Unobtrusive automatic background sync supported for Dropbox, Reminders (CalDAV) and CalDAV.


QUICK ENTRY

Save your thoughts as they come to you. Using a global hotkey, Quick Entry allows you to add tasks from any app or any Space.

2Do does it right. Quick Entry works even if 2Do was not launched or is not running in the background.


QUICK LOOK

Works just the way Quick Look does in Finder or other built-in OS X apps. Use the spacebar to zoom in and out of a task to preview notes, multi-line titles or other details attached
to your tasks.


ALARMS & NOTIFICATIONS

Stay on top of your tasks with alarms and notifications. Supports Notification Center as well as a built-in notification system which works even when 2Do is *not running*.

Set up automatic alarms for your tasks.


PASSWORD PROTECTION

Your life is a private affair. Manage it by locking out individual lists or the whole app with a single click.


AUTOMATIC BACKUPS

2Do values your tasks. Periodic automatic backups are created for you which can be transferred from one machine to another or from the iOS version of 2Do to the Mac and vice versa.

Save & restore of external backups


FLUID

Adding and editing tasks is blazing fast using in-place editors and popovers

2Do supports both mouse users, by offering them numerous shortcuts, as well as keyboard power-users by supporting dozens of keyboard shortcuts

2Do won’t slow down over time

Compatibility: OS X 10.10 or later 64-bit
