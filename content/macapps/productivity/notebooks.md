Notebooks allows you to create as many books as you need to write, store and structure your details of life, and it will quickly become the one and only repository for all journals, ideas, notes, drafts, stories and diaries but also for your projects, task lists, documents, files and everything else you want to keep close at hand.

Use Notebooks to create carefully formatted documents with styles and embedded photos, or to quickly write plain text notes. Convert between these formats any time, and if you want to use Markdown, Notebooks knows how to handle that as well. It is a perfect, distraction free writing environment.

Notebooks stores and displays almost any type of document: plain text and formatted text, PDF, web pages, MS Office documents, photos, videos, music and much more. Everything you want to keep organized can go directly into Notebooks.

Notebooks also keeps your task lists and allows you to tick off your to-dos as you complete them. Divide your projects into nested sub projects, which makes them easier to handle, and cross-reference into your reference library, which, of course, is in Notebooks, too.

Notebooks can share its files with the mobile versions of Notebooks on the iPad and iPhone, which allows you to conveniently work on your documents from your desktop, but also on your iPad, iPhone or iPod touch when you are on your way. The synchronization between the devices currently supports Dropbox and many WebDAV servers (with Dropbox currently being the most convenient option).

Notebooks stores all your documents as regular files on your computer’s hard drive, so you can always access them through Finder to open and edit with other applications, too.

So whether you need to write something down or look something up, you need to have Notebooks on your Mac.


Plain Text

Ignore keyboard shortcuts when a document is set as read only.

Correctly align text on ruled background when overscrolling is enabled.

Fine tuned the way automatically insert closing characters works.

Text documents no longer show a dark stripe instead of the scrollbar on macOS 10.13 or earlier, with scrollbars set to “always visible”.

Formatted Documents



When adding a table in the middle of a line, the table is added immediately after the current paragraph.

Toggling the list style with cmd-i now includes checklists.

Fine tuned the way automatically insert closing characters works.

Markdown

Notebooks’ default Markdown converter correctly resolves multiple references to the same footnotes.
Outline

The outline uses the setting Use color label as background color from preferences.

The selected book’s font remains dark (light theme).

Preferences

New option to select a fixed font size for print and PDF conversion.

The setting for line spacing accepts all available values.

Sharing…

Sharing from a document’s action menu tries to send the text instead of an attachment, if possible.

Sharing from the File Menu or document list always sends the selected items as attachment.
Misc

Duplicating a task with due date copies the due date as well.

The toolbar buttons appear with correct size and without overlapping title.

Notebooks no longer quits when closing the last window.

If the document browser is hidden when closing Notebooks, it remains hidden after relaunch.

Keyboard shortcut cmd-alt-B shows the document browser.

Extra document windows are restored in correct back to front order when starting Notebooks.
