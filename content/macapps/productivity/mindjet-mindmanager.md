Mindjet MindManager The all-new MindManager 2019 is here and it’s now the most integrated mapping solution in the world. With new universal file export, you can now share your MindManager content with anyone on any platform, exporting your best ideas, plans and notes to 700+ web apps.

Create and share dynamic information maps, mind maps, process flow diagrams, concept maps, project dashboards, and now interactive timelines. Or, turn your maps into interactive dashboards and receive updates when changes are made in any of the 700+ integrated apps. With new project planning tools, project timelines, workflow diagram improvements, and more new features and user interface enhancements, MindManager 2017 for Windows is a major release you won’t want to miss.

What’s New in Mindjet MindManager 2017:

More Powerful Sharing

Share your maps with everyone who needs to review your work. MindManager 2017 lets you export maps in HTML5 so you can easily share maps, meeting notes, action items, project plans, workflow diagrams, and more. Your export opens in almost any web browser so you can share the clarity and understanding of mind maps, concept maps and diagrams with everyone.

Powerful Integrations

Do more with MindManager and get the most out of the apps you already use. Create a project plan in MindManager and manage it in Asana. Map your meeting notes in and share the minutes in Google Docs. Receive updates in your project maps when your team adds documents to Google Drive, Box or OneDrive. Whatever the scenario, we’ve got you covered. Export map content to over 700 leading cloud apps with Zapier. Or, receive updates from these apps to transform your maps into powerful dashboards.

More Dynamic Layouts

Beyond interactive mind maps, org charts, workflow diagrams and concept maps, we’ve added a brand new diagram type, Timelines. Clearly illustrate product roadmaps, key project milestones, and marketing launch plans with the new dynamic Timeline layouts. Use powerful features like filtering to produce custom views, the marker index for easy navigation or the walk through mode for compelling presentations.

Better Project Planning & Management

MindManager’s project planning capabilities just got more powerful so you’ll never miss another deadline. Increase focus on deadlines and dependencies using the new critical path view. Filter on the critical path to focus on the most important activities impacting your project timeline. MindManager will also highlight tasks for you when they’re late, at risk or completed, saving you time and energy when you work your project plan.

More Visual

With over 700 topic images added to the Image Library, you can express your ideas and plans more powerfully, increasing retention and comprehension. All of MindManager’s templates have been updated with new scalable images.

More Convenient

Quickly store, retrieve, and share MindManager files using simplified file management. Whether you’re storing files on your desktop, accessing files in Microsoft SharePoint online or behind your firewall, or online with Box, MindManager 2017 for Windows provides a unified look and feel that makes it faster and simpler to work with and share your maps.

More Efficient

Simplify flowchart creation and increase process mapping efficiency using enhanced diagram tools. New tools include a fly-out topic shape selector and the ability to use right-angle relationship lines.
