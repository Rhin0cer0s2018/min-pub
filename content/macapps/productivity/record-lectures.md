Record Lectures was Featured by Apple in “Best New Apps” and as one of the best apps for ” Back to school”

Record Lectures was built with the purpose of allowing anyone who records lectures, meetings and conversations to be able to store them in a calendar and be able to share these recordings easily.

Record Lectures is a must have app for everyone who is going to school or attends conferences or meetings. Record Lectures allows students and business people to record and file lectures and presentations away into a neatly organized calendar marked by subject (topic).

The simplicity of operation of this app truly makes it a great tool. Seeing the lectures noted on the calendar for reference certainly makes it really organized and easy to find again and play back.

Record Lectures will make a big difference in your daily life when it comes to finding and using your recordings actively in your studies and business activities.
