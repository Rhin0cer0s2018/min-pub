Make it with Autodesk Maya computer animation software. Maya® 3D animation, modeling, simulation, and rendering software provides an integrated, powerful computer animation software. Maya® 3D animation, modeling, simulation, and rendering software provides an integrated, powerful toolset. Use it for animation, environments, motion graphics, virtual reality, and character creation.

UV editor workflow, look, and feel

The UV Editor interface has been overhauled, and includes a new UV Toolkit with better tools and functionality.

Clump modifier for interactive grooming

Generate realistic clumping effects in hair and fur for more natural-looking hair.

After Effects live link

Create a live link between Maya and Adobe® After Effects® to make real-time changes and view scenes simultaneously.

Additional MASH nodes

The MASH toolset gives you new nodes (curve, signal, world, placer, and more), as well as updates to existing nodes.

What's New:

Maya 2020

This release provides new tools and updates to help animators, modelers, riggers, and technical artists be more efficient and productive so they can spend more time on the creative.

There's no denying there is a lot here for animators to be happy аbout: over sixty new animation features build on the Maya 2019 release, plus new Time Slider bookmarks to help you organize your work in time and playback ranges. Updates to Cached Playback provide new preview modes and efficient caching for image planes and dynamics, giving you faster playback and more predictable results.

New Remesh and Retopologize commands let modelers spend less time cleaning up models, and for riggers and character TDs, we have new matrix-driven workflows plus a new wrap deformer. Overall, we hope you'll notice a smoother overall experience with the viewport, now that we've made some improvements that make more efficient use of your hardware.

Arnold GPU rendering is freshly out of beta and included with Maya 2020, alongside the new version of Bifrost that delivers significant performance improvements and several new pre-build graphs.
