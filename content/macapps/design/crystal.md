Crystal is your Android companion for Sketch. Install Crystal on your Android device and start mirroring designs instantly.

Your Design Companion

Crystal has your back when you're designing for mobile. UI and UX Designers have been relying on Crystal for years and we've racked up quite the stats.

Crystal offers everything Sketch Mirror for iOS does, and then more. Preview your Sketch designs in realtime, navigate prototypes and download content for offline viewing. Crystal intelligently connects to your regular computer when on the same WiFi, switches artboards when you change selection in Sketch and can hide your status and nav bars. Even open Sketch Cloud documents, so you can browse designs without a computer.

Blazing Fast USB Support

Whether you work on a corporate network or you just need a faster connection, Crystal lets you connect over USB. Download the Mac app below, move it to your Applications folder and start it up. Crystal for Mac runs unobtrusively in the background.
