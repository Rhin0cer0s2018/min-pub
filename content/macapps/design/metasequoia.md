Tetraface Inc Metasequoia Three-dimensional model design, especially the creation of human or animal-like characters, requires some knowledge in this area and, most importantly, a set of suitable tools for the job. For those who made some 3D creations using various specialized software solutions and need to work on them without having to install each program again, a utility like Metasequoia can be the right choice. This application manages to provide a strong set of features and make them available from a really friendly interface. There are several modes to operate Metasequoia, namely Beginner, Modeling (string), Modeling (icon) and Mapping.

Each of these styles comes with its commands for editing the loaded model, setting the appropriate lighting and more. There is a wide variety of objects that you can select and insert in the design, as well as some tools that are meant for modifying the model you are working on. The editing function that Metasequoia is equipped with are rather basic, but, nonetheless, cover all the necessary actions for handling objects, material faces, and vertices. Each selected portion of the design can be fixed, stored or restored when needed, as well as fit to view or set as the center of rotation. There are many customizations that can be made to the application from the ‘Configuration’ area, so you can assign, for instance, various actions to mouse buttons and key combinations. Texture rendering imperfections and some glitches that may occur can be avoided by adjusting the Direct3D and OpenGL preview options. All things considered, Metasequoia seems to be a worthy alternative to more complex utilities of its kind, especially thanks to the ease of use coupled with good support for a variety of formats this software is able to work with.
