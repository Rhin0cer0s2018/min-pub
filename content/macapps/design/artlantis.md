Artlantis 2020 – 3D Rendering Software. A pioneer in architectural visualization and compatible with all the 3D modeling software on the market, Artlantis is the easiest and fastest solution for creating photorealistic renderings and animations.


Artlantis 2020 – Main Features:

Interface

Designed with an extremely clear and ergonomic interface, Artlantis is both easy and comfortable to learn and use. At all times, the necessary tools are at hand near the real-time preview window, which allows you to see the results of each adjustment.

Simplicity

You don’t have to be skilled in computer graphics — learning and using Artlantis is easy and very fast. Artlantis is used by experts, advanced users and beginners alike to simulate, present and communicate their projects, by producing both high quality still images and animations with striking photo-realism in record time!

Real time preview

The reputation and success of Artlantis are based primarily on its founding concept: a preview of the scene allowing users continuous control of each change. Right from opening a 3D scene, navigating, changing shaders and objects, lights or 3D environment — all are immediately visible in the preview window.

Speed

The speed of displaying the scene, navigating, space positioning or light dispersion – in the preview and in the final rendering – is exceptional. While the Global Illumination, which assures the realism of scenes, is known to take a lot of calculation time, Artlantis is the only rendering software on the market to provide an efficient quality / time ratio. A “draft” mode allows a fast display of the preview during the preparation phases.

2D window

In addition to the 3D preview, Artlantis has a 2D window for positioning cameras or sequences, making it easy to set up a panorama path to explore the project.

Viewpoints

Define and save as many views as you want: in perspective, in parallel view, in insertion or panorama, each with its own light settings.

Depth of field

Just as a photographer chooses an apperture, in Artlantis, you can set the depth of field, the ISO and the shutter speed for as many views as you want. Whether you focus on an object, on a specifc point in space or infinity, you can easily set the blur with the help of a slider.

Parallel views

Parallel views (projections and cuts) can be set in the dedicated inspector, based on the type of projection (elevation, axonometry, top view), camera positioning, view width, or the definition of the cutting planes … A control bar allows you to edit the main settings of the project in its environment.

Perspectives and verticals

Each point of view has its own infinite ground, level, materials and background or foreground images easy to manipulate, resize or even adjust the edges in the preview. Artlantis has a vertical function that makes a perspective mode particularly interesting for high-rise projects.
