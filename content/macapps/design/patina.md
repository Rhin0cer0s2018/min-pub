Patina is a great way to draw sketches, diagrams, and simple illustrations. As a Mac user accustomed to attractive, well-designed software, you’ll appreciate Patina’s elegant and intuitive interface.

And if you’ve used Windows before, you’ll find that Patina not only offers the simplicity you like about Microsoft Paint, but also has some great additional features, including:

Continuous shape rotation – objects can be rotated at any angle instead of being limited to specific degrees of rotation

Easy tool width adjustment – use the slider to adjust the thickness of shape strokes as well as text font size

Intuitive color management – user-configurable favorite colors are prominently displayed and easily selected or edited

Transparent image saving – allows you to create an image that has no background color

Independently moveable crop frame – easily move and resize crop frame without affecting the image

Alpha blending of colors – blend a translucent color with the canvas color to create a new color

Anti-aliasing control – turn on and off smooth edges at any time



Compatibility: macOS 10.10 or later 64-bit
