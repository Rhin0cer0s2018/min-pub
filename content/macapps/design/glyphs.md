Glyphs is a full-featured and powerful glyph design application that was thought from the get-go to provide its users with the most complete font creation toolset on the macOS platform. Moreover, Glyphs makes it simple and painless to effortlessly combine both letter-form viewing and editing within the same minimalist user interface.

For instance, you can draw the exact shape for your glyph, adjust its spacing and kerning, and use the preview panel to get a quick overview of what the end result will look like once exported.

Sketch your font

Take a pencil and sketch a few letters. With a few tricks, you can easily digitize your sketches, and, step by step, create a full-fledged OpenType font.

Tools for type

The smart vector tools are optimised for the design of typefaces. Interpolated nudging, curvature control, dragging multiple handles at once, adding extrema and inflections, batch editing: all supported straight out of the box.

All languages covered

Human-readable glyph names, combined with smart component placement, automatic alignment of diacritics, mark positioning, and Unicode 7 support, make Glyphs the number one choice for multilingual font development.

Isolation no more

Watch your words take shape in high resolution: The edit view doubles as a text editor, allowing you to draw, edit, space and kern your glyphs in a word context rather than isolated in windows.

Colors everywhere

Why stay monochromatic? Add color to your typographical life with the built-in multi-layer preview and specialized editing tools. Glyphs can export layer fonts, Microsoft-style color webfonts or Apple-style emoji fonts.

Effortless OpenType

Enjoy automatic OpenType features: Glyphs analyzes your glyph names and shapes, and can auto-build feature code for ligatures, figure sets, positional forms, localizations, fractions, stylistic sets, small caps, and many more.

Interpolation unchained

Up to three axes, any number of font masters, independent layers, glyph-based alternate and intermediate masters: You can do it all in Glyphs. Easily switch between masters, control outline compatibility and style linking, and generate a whole family in one go.

Mark attachment done right

No more time-consuming fiddling with feature code: Glyphs can build the mark attachment features automatically for you, and even interpolate positions.

Full control batch processing

Custom Parameters allow you to precisely steer what happens at the production stage. You always work in your design file, keep overlaps, and Glyphs takes care of the rest, using your parameters to build the installable font file.

Radicals rethought

Letter parts or CJK radicals that re-appear in other glyphs, can be interpolated in place with Smart Components. This way, you can adjust the shape of the part without losing its stroke and contrast.

Take a hint

Improve your font’s screen appearance with the built-in autohinter. Or manually hook up PostScript hints and TrueType instructions to your outlines. In Multiple Master files, hints in the first master are automatically copied to compatible masters.

Extend

Third-party plugins such as Yanone’s amazing SpeedPunk, Python script libraries, and XML for alternate glyph data: extending and modifying the app’s functionality is a snap. With the freely available SDK, you can even roll your own.

Requirements: Mac OS X 10.9.5 or later required.
