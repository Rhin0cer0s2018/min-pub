Kite Compositor lets you visually drag and drop layers to build complex interfaces on a WYSIWYG canvas. Add animations and tune them with the integrated timeline. Use the built-in jаvascript scripting environment to enhance the detail of each interaction. Incorporate custom logic and behavior to achieve exactly what you need.

Features

Timeline – The integrated smart timeline allows you to drag and edit animation durations and keyframes. Snap animation start and end times
together for a precise, hand-tuned feel.

Inspector – A robust and powerful object inspector allows you to edit all of your layers’ properties in just a few clicks. Set colors,
ajust animation curves, add CoreImage filters – all at the click of a mouse.

Library – Drag-and-drop layers and animations from the library to build your interface visually. Save reuseable layer hierarchies into
your library for easy component reuse.

Design on Mac, View on iOS – Are you ready to get a sense of how your designs feel on an actual iOS device? Download the native companion
app, Kite Compositor for iOS.

Import from Sketch – Easily import your designs from Sketch with Kite’s native import feature. Preserve editable bezier paths and text by
importing your Sketch layers as native Kite layers.

Export – Share your designs by exporting a movie or gif recording of your animation.

Scriptable – Add sophisticated logic to your animations and interactions via the built-in jаvascript scripting engine. Query and make live
edits to your running animation from the built-in jаvascript console. Fire animations, add new layers, change properties and much more.

Built on CoreAnimation – Kite was built from the ground up for Mac using macOS’s native CoreAnimation technology. CoreAnimation is one of
the key underpinning graphics technologies on Mac and iOS that produces stunning animations at high framerates.

Compatibility: macOS 10.12 or later 64-bit
