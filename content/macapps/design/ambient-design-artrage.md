Ambient Design ArtRage Unleash your creativity! Paint and draw with tools that work just like the real thing. ArtRage is a digital artist’s studio with a full range of familiar tools that look and work like the real things.

It’s a canvas for thick, expressive oils and delicate watercolors, a sketchpad with a full set of pencils, and a sheet of paper with a stack of wax crayons all in one.

Main ArtRage Features:

Realistic Painting Tools: Oils, Watercolour, and Palette Knives let you smear paint, blend colors, and easily create natural textures.

Layers and Groups: Organise your painting in to layers and groups which support blend modes and other features.

References & Tracing Images: Import an image as a Reference while you work, or as a Tracing Image to guide your strokes and color choices. Customizable Workspace: Work in light or dark mode, with a choice of classic ArtRage layout or a flexible docking layout.

Custom Brush: Create your own unique tools and special efects using the powerful Custom Brush designer. Grids, Guides, and Perspective: Guide your composition with a comprehensive set of grids, guides, and perspective layout tools. Ease of Use: Pick a tool and off you go – ArtRage is designed to focus on Art, not navigating a mass of tool settings.

Utility Tools: Create complex designs with Symmetry, fill areas with patterns or gradients, and more. Scripting: Record your process to a script that can be played back later to recreate your painting, live.

What’s New in ArtRage 6: Paint with Depth in the Custom Brush: Add volume to your Custom Brush strokes, or use any Custom Brush as an Eraser. Complementary

Colors: Let ArtRage help with your color choices by automatically displaying a variety of types of complement. Record Actions: Automate processes to repeat with a single button press, or write your own action scripts for special effects.

Customize your Canvas: Get more control over the look of your canvas with lighting intensity and angle adjustments. Gloss and Impasto: Try out thicker paint strokes and adjust the level of gloss in the updated Oil Brush tool. And much more… Retina support on macOS, smoothing in the standard Pencil, narrow mode pickers, and more!



macOS: ArtRage is compatible with macOS 10.8 and later.
