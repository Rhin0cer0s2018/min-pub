Optimized for professional use, the FontExplorer X Pro solution gives you the power you need to manage all your fonts. Now you can more easily manage, activate and organize your existing font collection as well as find and experiment with new fonts. Whether you’ve got a hard drive full of typefaces or a few cherished families, FontExplorer X Pro handles your font library quickly, efficiently and reliably. And when you’re ready to add to your collection, you can view thousands of classic designs and the latest releases from independent foundries using the integrated store.

FontExplorer X Pro features an intuitive user interface with a configurable toolbar, activation control, and comprehensive font information at your fingertips, customizable font previews, back-up functionality and access to FontExplorer X Server. Used together, FontExplorer X Pro and FontExplorer X Server are your complete solution for organizing, exploring and buying fonts and managing font licenses.

Font Tile ViewThe new Font Tile View provides font previews composed of selected character sets. These previews are particularly helpful for customers evaluating type based on one or two select characters (e.g. a designer looking for typefaces containing a capital A without a crossbar for a logo that needs a futuristic feel.) The larger, artistic showings also provide a fun, alternative way to browse type.

Customizable previewPreviewing type is an essential capability for anyone working with Fonts frequently. FontExplorer X Pro has always offered several options for configuring previews based on our users’ needs. With FontExplorer X Pro 5, preview configuration options have been consolidated and are now conveniently located at the side of the preview. Customizable list view Font size, style linking, grouping of font families or any other type of font information – FontExplorer X Pro lets you decide what you want to see and what you don’t.

With FontExplorer X Pro 5 we have placed all the available options in the list view – right where you need it. Unicode® 7 support Unicode 7.0 adds a total of 2,834 characters, encompassing 23 new scripts and many new symbols, as well as character additions to many existing scripts. Symbols say more than words. If you’ve ever wanted to see all the characters of a font containing the complete Unicode 7.0 character range, FontExplorer X Pro 5 can help you do just that.

Now FontExplorer X Pro will display the new and updated character sets of this new standard, which now includes 250 new emoji symbols. Check out the new fancy emojis in the Apple Color Emoji font to fully appreciate this feature. Support for latest Web Font formats FontExplorer X Pro not only supports all commonly used desktop font formats, it can also help you organize your Web fonts.

FontExplorer X Pro 5 offers support for WOFF 2, the latest Web font format. Enable/Disable fonts manually While this may be a fundamental feature of any font management application, FontExplorer X Pro tackles this task with uncommon ease. Whether you select a single font, a group of Fonts, a Set or a Smart Set, activation or deactivation is only a checkbox away. And yes, you can also use a key combination. Select “Activate” from the menu or right-click to start the task.   and more…
