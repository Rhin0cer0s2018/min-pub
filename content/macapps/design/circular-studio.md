The most powerful “tiny planet” app for the Mac. Circular Studio is a new twist on photo editing. Turn your photos into amazing circular images.

Circular Studio is a fun app with powerful new features never seen before in this type of app. You can easily zoom in and out of your circular image to get it just right. Once you’re happy with your image, add professional effects such as lens flares and sky objects like the sun, moon, birds, etc.

Another really cool feature is a collection of “center” objects. These include spheres, planets, and geometric shapes to place at the center of your image circle. This turns your image into a unique mini world.
