MODO is your starting point for creative exploration. Whether you’re creating addictive experiences in real-time, innovative product designs, attractive advertising images or compelling content of films and videos, user-friendly tools with artists MODO allow you to iterate freely to the creative potential of their ideas reality.

Mode Functions

Modeling

Modo® offers a unique combination of the best direct modeling tools that work hand in hand with a modeling system highly robust and flexible procedures. In addition, mode presents the award – winning MeshFusion Boolean tools, integrated functionality and retopología sculpture.

Flows work UV

Saca the drudgery of tedious tasks of creating UV with a set of tools integrated highly efficient offering many automated options, it supports flows Udim work and, unlike other tools , 3D content creation, is fully integrated with workflow modeling and selection.

Sculpt

Take your artistic expression to 3D modeling because it uses modeling tools based on integrated mode to speed up brushes volumes intuitively and add multiple levels of fine detail with speed.

Shading

Optimize your workflow with nodal shading systems based on fast and flexible layers to create sophisticated and convincing materials easily. The drag and drop presets allow you to quickly develop the look you want, or just select from a large library of highly realistic physically realistic materials.

Representation

Enjoy a photorealistic rendering at incredible speeds and unlimited resolutions, including representation network is free. The processor mode and checked based production mode offers a rare combination of speed and quality.

Baking

Check the bake textures while and watch progressively refines. Mode also lets you adjust the settings and make changes to the surface without waiting for a final rendering, and baked accurately standards Unity or Unreal without additional tools.

Rig

A set of non – destructive, non – linear and a fully integrated work flow tools modular, flexible rigging system based on node mode lets you create, edit, manage and easily reuse complex characters platforms.

Animation

By incorporating traditional animation techniques applied in innovative ways within 3D animation mode is highly customizable to meet the most demanding production challenges.

Effects

The Addressable particles based on rules so they work together with fully integrated rigid and soft bodies, and fragmentation procedures to enable you to create compelling dynamic simulations in less time.

Hair and skin

Mode allows you to create and manipulate realistic hair, hair, grass, feathers and other fiber – based effects as actual geometry that can be sculpted, shading and represent directly to your scene.

Camera and projection tools

Advanced mode tools for creating virtual cameras and digital matte painting are perfect for set extensions and product placement shots, while the team of spherical camera lets you work with video 360 ° .

presets

Segment your work into manageable parts, avoid repetitive modeling tasks and create a repeatable appearance with assemblies and storable, shareable and reusable presets. In addition, it makes a series of modeling operations in a new specialized procedures to share with other tool.

Collaboration and personalization

With support in the graphics window for Unity, PBR materials and tools compatible with integrated Unreal export mode provides a true WYSIWYG experience creating assets for games and virtual reality authoring. In addition, support for a wide range of standard file formats industry, along with Python scripting and macro means it is easy to make working on your online mode.

Performance and efficiency improvements

Mode provides accelerated performance in several key areas: support for OpenSubdiv 3 offers faster deformations; caching accelerates the display of animations; MeshFusion localized assessment improves interactivity; and instances are drawn faster. A lot of improvements in workflow also increases productivity artist, including improvements to the export of games, the ability to duplicate items while interactively transforms and new methods of selection in the Item List.

Modeling workflow improvements

I strengthening its position as the best solution modeling class, Mode 11.0 offers new features MeshFusion including the ability to cut, copy, and paste Fusion elements; automatic retropología improvements, including a new adaptive curvature and metric mode; a number of improvements in workflow modeling procedures; preview brush to paint and sculpt tools; HUD and a new customizable tool for faster access to the tools you use most.

Best experience out of the box

With experience simplified and based logon facility licenses; including platforms for modeling procedures; new presets and better processing settings defaults that facilitate the creation of high-quality representations noiselessly without specialized expertise; and an emphasis on solving known problems, 11.0 mode provides a better experience ready to use. Other improvements include easier access to recent projects, training videos and online help; and the ability to run in Safe Mode for debugging purposes.
