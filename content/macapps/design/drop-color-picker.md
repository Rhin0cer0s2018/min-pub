Drop – Color Picker is a delightful little color picker for developers and designers.

Pick a color and it will be copied in your preferred format. It’s that easy.

Zooming Picker

Picking a one pixel border? No worries! You can freely zoom the picker in and out with your scroll wheel or trackpad.

Accurate

Most color pickers (including Apple’s) don’t pick the exact color value because of reasons that we have to understand but you don’t. Drop lets you pick the exact color by switching the color profile associated with the app you are picking from.

Dark Mode

For all those fans of the dark side, we got you covered.

Touch Bar

That’s right, get quick access to all your colors right from your fancy new Touch Bar. It’s the most convenient way to have quick access to your colors. Ever.

Just the formats you use

Quickly switch between the common formats you are actually going to need your colors copied into: HEX, RGB, Swift UIColor, Swift NSColor, Objective-C UIColor, and Objective-C NSColor.

Palette

Save colors for later in your color palette.

Delight

This app was built with more TLC than you can even imagine. It’s those little details that make all the difference.

What’s New:

Version 1.6

NEW FEATURE: Added support to run in the dock or just in the menu bar

Updated for macOS Catalina

Updated the look of preferences

The app now remembers the window location when the app is closed
