ZBrush 2020 empowers artists with greater sculpting flexibility via powerful additions to the award winning brush system. We have expanded the library of sculpting brushes with the new XTractor, HistoryRecall and DecoCurve brushes.

In addition, you can now constrain your brush strokes to only forward gestures with the new No Back&Forth modifier. Beyond the new brushes weâ€™ve expanded the capabilities of the MorphUV feature, which makes it possible to view the unwrapped UV layout of a model within ZBrush.

Sculpt & Paint in Morph UV allows you to sculpt and paint on the 2D unwrap of a model, applying all updates to the 3D model.
