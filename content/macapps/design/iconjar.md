Iconjar Designed to make the life of app developers and designers a little bit easier, IconJar is a lightweight and user-friendly icon organizer for your Mac.

In a few words, IconJar makes it as easy as possible for you to store large collections of icons under one roof and organize them efficiently, so they will always be within arm’s reach when you need them.

Everything feels natural and looks top notch thanks to a responsive and native macOS interface, with a Set panel on the left side, a tag panel on the right side, and a search bar on the upper right part of the main window.

Also noteworthy is the fact that IconJar enables you to customize the size of your icons and to view only Bitmap or only Vector types.

The IconJar app enables you to create sets of icons or add icons to already existing sets, and to import sets of icons SVG, PNG, and GIF formats. Not only this but the app can also help you organize your icons with the help of its tagging system.


Bundle similar icons with Smart Sets

IconJar now lets you create rule based sets. Smart sets are great for when you have a favourite style, prefer a specific file type, or want to show every icon with a certain license.

View recently used icons

IconJar automatically adds the icons you’ve used to a recently used set in the left sidebar.

Star your favourite icons

You can now star the icons you like the most. Starred icons are all grouped in one set so you never have to search for them.

Full compatability with macOS 10.15 Catalina

Our color picker now includes an eye-dropper tool

UI changes througout the whole app

You can now also change the color of gradients

You can now have IconJar search for, and clean up, duplicate icons

You can now filter your icon set list by keyword

We now link out to licenses from the inspector when a url for the license is provided

We now allow users to opt-in for beta releases

Trigger search with a keystroke with “always active search”

We have implemented basic Touchbar support for the grid

You can now sort the grid

You can choose to have the grid grouped by set or not

You can now drag icons and iconjar files directly into the set list for inplace adding

You can now drag out sets from the list and instantly create iconjar files

We have added SVG export options to the preferences to customize SVG processing

You can now improve icon constrast when using Aqua instead of just in Dark mode

If moving a library when IconJar is not open, we keep track of it and wont need to refind it again

Managing licenses has now been given its own window instead of inside Preferences

Quicklook has been simplified and is detachable, this also respects the grid dark mode

Grid can now display up to 256pt sizes

Updated IJSVG to fix a lot of rendering issues with gradients

You can now right click and copy, or copy code from Quickdrag

The grid size controls now overlay the grid but are unobtrusive

We have ramped up performance throughout the application
