NewTek LightWave 3D® allows anyone to become an artist and 3D animator. The software is affordable, complete, easy to learn and use, and is well established as one of the leading 3D systems on the market to produce beautiful photorealistic renderings and incredible animes. This complete solution ready to use 3D animation now offers interactive real-time 3D collaborative across a bridge to Unreal Engine.

New features in LightWave 2019:

Real – time collaboration of LightWave ™ to Unreal Engine

LightWave 3D® Era enters the real – time exchange with this workflow link between LightWave 3D® Unreal Engine and focusing on driving LightWave. Iterative changes are unreal. LightWave multiple seats can be connected simultaneously to the same Unreal Editor to allow real–time collaboration between artists. The bridge uses the proven discovery mechanism NDI® NewTek networks for easy automatic configuration, and may be limited to using a single project in Unreal, or installed as a general supplement for use in all projects Unreal.

FBX and the new bridge exchange

FBX work with standard industry data on a whole new level through the new Interchange Bridge.

Interactively choose what to import / export and how.

Add to existing FBX files Layout and Modeler.

LightWave 3D® create resources from many FBX files.

Again easily visit the FBX files through workspaces.



Customization tools shader model

The ability to separate materials and create them according to your tastes LightWave 3D® is new for 2019. There is access to the functions
of Fresnel, materials and components integrators materials. The toolkit of materials has been updated with new nodes to support this
capability.



Content creation OpenVDB

LightWave 3D® 2018 introduced the ability to import and generate a volume of mist OpenVDB. LightWave 3D® New for 2019 is a set of tools
that allow node content creation OpenVDB. You can now create grids OpenVDB from meshes, particles and even the distance estimator
primitively. The toolkit allows operations live Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG), filtering grid includes tracking level sets, smoothing,
dilation and erosion. Solvers that allow fluid simulation and the effects of smoke and fire are included.



metamorphic

Metamorphic is a plug-in animatable mesh sculpting and manipulation vertex maps for LightWave 3D 2019 running on Layout, and leverages the
new capabilities of the modifier stack.

Freeform animated sculpture.

Built undo / redo system

fully multithreaded sculpture using all available CPU cores

support pen pressure for size, strength and hardness of the brush (Windows only)

Support texture Nodal brush

Three modes of animation

Interpolation nonlinear frame key animation sculpting

Supports conversion keyframes sculptures Endomorphs

Predictive corrective morphological sculpture works after deformers with integrated controller / driver

Support Full Motion Blur



Scale screen

support to scale many elements of the user interface screens HiDPI and large screen

Options independent scaling for multiple monitor configurations



Bone system improved game development

the new option bone Type, Limited bones, allows the animator set a limit on the design of the amount of bone that affect a certain point
to match the limit on the lens motor game, and performs optimizations in real time to adapt better performance. Engines expect from a
platform game.



Shader Edge Node

A node to simulate beveled or rounded edges processing time for more realistic results without increasing geometry.
