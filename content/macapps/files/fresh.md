Fresh allows you to instantly find attachments you download, no matter what weird name they have. Rename files that you just downloaded, then file them with a single click.

Filed Documents is a place where Fresh will file items by date, helping keep you organized. With Fresh you can easily find any file – no matter where you are – without going back to the Finder. Plus it has an awesome ‘file dock’ which works like the dock, but who has room for files on their dock anymore?

Features

Instantly access the files that you are working on.

Downloads from the web show up without having to remember the file name.

Usually access it with a configurable keyboard shortcut.

Built for macOS Sierra. Runs back to 10.8.

Works with full screen apps – grab that file without ever leaving full screen mode.

Shows recent files, favourites (like a dock), spotlight search, or just navigate to any file directly.

Shows all recently changed files automatically.

Rename or trash files.

Preferences for many options.

Indispensable.

Runs as small icon in menu bar.

Large easy to use UI hides itself when you drag files out.
