AweEraser is a secure Mac data eraser. It can securely and permanently erase data from hard drive/storage media, permanently delete Mac files, wipe hard drive, and erase already deleted data under Mac OS. It also offers tools to help you batch remove applications on your Mac and clean up browsers histories, caches, privacy, etc.

We know that the deleted or formatted data can be recovered by data recovery software. So, if you are going to sell, donate or giveaway your Mac, USB, digital camera, you should make sure your private data has been permanently erased rather than just deleting the files, emptying trash bin or formatting the device. AweEraser for Mac offers government & military level data erasure standards to ensure permanently destroying the targeted data without affecting the operating life of your computer or device. The certified data erasure methods include HMG Infosec Standard 5, German FOFIS, DOD 5220.22-M, U.S. Army AR380-19, Peter Gutmannâ€™s algorithm, etc.

This Mac data eraser is pretty simple to use. It offers flexible and reliable data erasures. Option 1: shred files/folders. Option 2: wipe entire hard drive/device to permanently erase all data from the hard drive and device. Option 3: erase free disk space to permanently erase already deleted/formatted data. AweEraser for Mac also offers uninstaller and internet cleaner. The uninstaller can help you uninstall applications in batches and delete all related files including app junk, registry files, caches, etc. AweEraser for Mac is 100% safe. It ensures permanently erasing targeted data on your hard drive, USB flash drive, digital camera, memory card, RAID, server, and other storage media. It will not cause any physical damage to your device and only erase the data you want to erase.
