Experience better compression with the ZSTD method. Compress and decompress files faster, all while achieving better rates than alternatives like DEFLATE and DEFLATE64.

New! Work faster with improved Zipx Compression:

New! Get support when you need it for Mac OS Catalina:

WinZip is now updated to operate on Mac OS 10.15. You can count on our support team to solve issues quickly so you can get back to 
projects faster.

New! Customize your WinZip experience with dark mode:

It’s not just a trend- dark mode can prolong the battery on your device and reduce eye strain. WinZip now supports this theme for improved 
user experience.

New! Boost your workflow with additional file add methods:

In addition to traditional options, you can now choose to:

Freshen – replace only files already in the Zip file with newer files.

Move – delete files/folders after they are added to the Zip file.

Update – replace updated files AND add files not already in Zip file.

New! Automate Backup Tasks with a few simple clicks (Pro Only):

Great for repetitive zipping tasks, WinZip Backups make life easier with intuitive automation. Create the backup once and then run it 
anytime you want with a couple of taps of the mouse.

New! Easy roll-outs of WinZip for Business users:

Using WinZip with a large team? This one’s for you! Individual acceptance of the user license agreement is no longer required, making it 
easier than ever to install WinZip and get to work.
