Dropshare  Your very own secure file sharing tool! Dropshare is a menu bar application for Drag&Drop upload files, screenshots and even directories to your own server, Amazon S3 or Rackspace Cloud Files. Sharing files with friends, customers, colleagues or anyone else has never been so professional!



Dropshare supports SCP over SSH, a secure industry standard protocol for file transfers. Uploads to Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) or Rackspace Cloud Files are also supported, which both are low-priced file hosting services in the cloud. Compared to other cloud hosted file sharing services, Dropshare directly connects to your very own Amazon S3 bucket or Rackspace Cloud Files container, so there is no third-party involved at all.

Dropshare supports Multiple Connections: You can set up different upload destinations at the same time and switch between them using user-defined keyboard shortcuts!

### Uploads everything

No matter if files, folders, text or screenshots – Dropshare uploads every file and data to your selected destination – also from clipboard or other applications like Safari. Share Extension included!

### Share and annotate screenshots!

Set up your own keyboard shortcuts for fullscreen or selection-based screenshots that’ll be uploaded automatically with Dropshare. Set up a custom keyboard shortcut for taking a screenshot and annotating it afterwards with an app you like: Preview.app, Skitch.app or Napkin.app!

### Screen Recordings

Take & upload Screen Recordings directly with Dropshare, both fullscreen and selection-based recordings are available, as well as GIF conversion!

### Dropshare Safe

Easily create access-restricted URLs for your uploads with either a lifetime and/or password.

### Beautiful individual landing pages

Choose from a number of free designs or craft an individual design on your own using HTML, CSS and javascript. A preview can be embedded for several file types, e.g. images, text or video files.

### Choose your URL shortener

Dropshare supports URL shorteners as well – natively supported URLs (e.g. dsh.re), or configure your very own URL shortener service like bit.ly (for hosted services) or YOURLS (for self-hosted services).

### Dropshare Sync

Synchronize your upload history across all your devices which have Dropshare installed.

### 1-Click Delete from your server

Whenever you decide that you no longer want to share a specific file, just use Dropshare to delete it from the upload destination again.

### Markdown to HTML

If enabled, Dropshare automatically converts Markdown files to HTML.

Compatibility: OS X 10.9 or later, 64-bit processor
