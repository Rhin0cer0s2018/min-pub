Paperless is a digital documents manager. Remember when everyone talked about how we would soon be a paperless society? Now it seems like we use paper more than ever. Let’s face it – we need and we use paper. But Paperless is one of those incredibly useful applications that will help you manage all your paper and digital documents and at the same time positively affect the environment.
