ExpanDrive acts just like a USB drive plugged into your PC. Open, edit, and save files on remote computers from within your favorite programs—even when they are on a server half a world away.

ExpanDrive enhances every single application on your computer by transparently connecting it to remote data.

ExpanDrive 7 now includes an incredibly powerful cloud storage browser and transfer app along with the best network drive for the cloud. Add SFTP to Explorer With ExpanDrive, you can securely access any remote file server directly from Explorer, or even the command line.

No need to open a separate SFTP client just for file transfer.

ExpanDrive extends the way all applications on your PC can access data.

Reconnect with grace Once you’re connected, you stay connected. If you change access points or bring your computer out of sleep, you’ll stay connected. Our robust networking core ensures that if a connection is available, your drive is available.

Ridiculously Simple — it just works Our client is dead simple—there is nothing to install or configure on the server.

No complicated instructions.

No administrative hassles. Just use your existing login credentials to securely access your remote files.

Compatibility: OS X 10.9 or later 64-bit
