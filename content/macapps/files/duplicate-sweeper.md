Duplicate Sweeper uses an advanced search algorithm to detect files on your Mac that have the same content even if they have a different file name. It is not uncommon to amass duplicate files throughout general use of your Mac. Whilst some of these duplicate files may have their uses, the ones that do not are unnecessarily taking up storage space.

Duplicate Sweeper can detect these files and remove them to claim back that storage space. Duplicate Sweeper allows you to specify which folders on your Mac to search for duplicates in. This allows you to include only the folders that you want into the search and exclude the folders that you do not. This way you can choose to leave out important folders or places where you have purposely created duplicate files such as backup files.
