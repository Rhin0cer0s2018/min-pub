Shredo Securely erase file and folders and make sure the information cannot be recovered by re-writing the data up to 35 times while using various algorithms. Marking files for deletion does not mean the data is instantly erased from the drive: the information remains stored until the operating system decides to write new data on top of it As a result, there are numerous file recovery tools out there that offer you the possibility to get back items that you have deleted by mistake. Shredo is a small utility that can help you make the recovery process harder or even impossible.

Depending on the security level and the data erasure rate, you have 3 methods of grinding:

1-pass – Provides reliable protection and quick data deletion.

7-pass – slow speed, but better protection than 1 pass.

35-pass is slow, but provides better protection.



Compatibility: OS X 10.10 or later 64-bit
