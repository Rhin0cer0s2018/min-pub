Official desktop client for the WhatsApp Web platform that enables you to take advantage of what the service has to offer without cluttering your web browser

WhatsApp is a mobile messaging app that enables you to communicate with your friends via text messages by using your data plan instead of having the carrier deliver SMS messages that you must pay individually, hence increasing your costs.

The WhatsApp desktop app enables you to use the service from the comfort of your Mac, without going through a web browser, as long as the computer is connected to your mobile device.

Link your Mac and your mobile phone by using the QR Code scanner

The WhatsApp desktop client is essentially a standalone application for the WhatsApp Web platform, which means the same rules apply when connecting to the network. You must use the QR Code scanner incorporated in the mobile app to scan the code generated on the desktop side.

Note that WhatsApp provides companion apps for some of the most popular mobile operating systems available, such as iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Nokia Symbian, Nokia S40, or Windows Phone. This way, you get to connect your Mac to the WhatsApp service regardless of the mobile phone model.

Chat with your friends, include emoticons in your messages or share and receive files

The WhatsApp OS X app provides support for all the web platform capabilities, going from starting new conversations or groups to capturing photos with the help of the iSight camera and sharing them with your friends.

The WhatsApp utility also integrates with the OS X Notification Center, and you get to receive both audio and desktop alerts. The notifications can also include text previews. Moreover, WhatsApp also enables you to disable them for a given period.

Official desktop client for the WhatsApp mobile messaging platform

To sum up, WhatsApp offers you the possibility to keep in touch with your friends and receive or share documents from the comfort of a desktop application. The app relies on the WhatsApp account active on your mobile phone and also has access to the conversationâ€™s history.

Compatibility: OS X 10.9 or later
