Importer for Contacts picks up where Apple Contacts left off by importing Excel files, CSV files, tab-delimited files, and vCards into “Contacts” with more options.

As a bonus, it can also convert CSV and Excel files to vCard files directly without the need to import them first. The app is also able to restore Address Book groups from vCards.

Features:

Imports Excel files (.xlsx), including embedded pictures

Imports vCards with automatic group restoration

Maps fields automatically and remembers field mappings for future imports.

Lets you save mappings to make repeated imports easier

Supports custom labels

Accepts CSV files that Apple’s Contacts app refuses to open

Can perform automatic group assignment. Groups that do not already exist will be created. In your import file, simply add a column with a comma-separated list of group names that the contact should be a member of.

Supports line breaks in CSV and tab-delimited text file fields (street addresses, notes, etc.) if the file is properly formatted

Fields not supported by Contacts can be added to the “Note” field

Comes with an interactive preview to make it easier to determine the character encoding of the import file – helpful if you don’t know which encoding was used or if you have no idea what a character encoding is.

What’s New:

Version 1.6:

Added support for macOS 11 Big Sur

Added support for Macs with Apple Silicon processor

Fields imported into notes can now be formatted with various options for better readability. These options can be set in the app’s preferences.

When importing group names from a FileMaker repeating field, the individual values are now automatically recognized.

Improved reliability when extracting labels from label/value lists.

Fixes a bug that caused a crash that occurred when an Excel date field contained an invalid value.


Compatibility: OS X 10.10 or later, 64-bit processor
