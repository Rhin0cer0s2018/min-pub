SonicWeb Internet Radio Player is a powerful internet radio player and recorder. Listen to free Internet radio, record multiple radio stations simultaneously and listen to your recordings as often you like, whenever you want.

=== Discover new music ===

Tunein to more than three thousand free, hand selected, high quality internet radio stations or add your own radio stations.

=== Fully featured internet radio player ===

Browse popular and recommended radio stations, set favorites, filter by genre or bitrate and search by name.

=== Advanced internet radio recorder ===

Record multiple stations simultaneously.

Record continuously or automatically split the internet radio streams into tracks and put them into a playlist.

Timeshift internet radio: pause and resume playback at any time without any gaps.

=== Custom playlists ===

Create custom playlists from the tracks you like. Keep the tracks as long as you want and play them as many times as you like.

=== Unique to SonicWeb: The powerful station list feature ===

With several simultaneously turned on radio stations your playlist will quickly contain many unplayed tracks. This enables you to skip tracks you don’t like without any skip limit as long as there are more tracks available in your playlist.

Enjoy gapless audio playback with tracks from different radios stations crossfading into each other. SonicWeb dynamically adjusts the volume of loud and silent tracks so that you don’t have to.

Together these features create your own personal radio station: seamless playback of diverse playlists with ever changing tracks that you can control just like a regular media player.

=== Deep Mac OS X integration ===

– Menu bar icon. Keep your dock tidy. SonicWeb can hide its dock icon and show an icon in the menu bar instead.

– Background notifications. SonicWeb can show background notifications in Mountain Lion’s Notification Center.
