Watch your home, kids, and pets from anywhere! Simply plug in your camera, or use the Mac’s built-in one, and feature-rich Periscope Pro does the rest. Easy to use, OS X El Capitan ready, motion detection, clip uploading, and much more!

You wanted a simple-to-use, fully-featured video surveillance app for your Mac, and Periscope Pro delivers!

Periscope Pro is compatible with the Mac’s built-in camera, or countless other third-party / stand-alone IP cameras. You can monitor and/or record anything – your desk, your front door, the kid’s playroom, the baby’s room, your vacation house – anything. With features like motion detection, video/sound recording, and clip uploading, you’ll never miss a moment (or you’ll finally find out who is stealing your snacks from your desk!)

With its sophisticated motion and sound detection systems, you can set it to only record when there is something to see (this leaves fewer clips to sort through, and less storage used.) You can also record continuously if you wish. Clips are stored on your Mac for viewing and can be automatically uploaded to Dropbox so you can see what’s happening from anywhere, with any device!

By themselves, IP Cameras can be difficult to setup, but it’s fast and easy with Periscope Pro (in fact, it’s downright automatic!) Just input the camera’s address and model, and it does the rest. The setup screen preview window allows you see what’s happening as you set it up, so there’s no need to switch between screens (yes, we thought of everything!)

If you need to monitor covertly, using a USB or IP camera lets you separate the camera from your Mac (so there’s no telltale green light) and hide the camera anywhere. Sneaky, huh?

But all of this ease of use and feature set wouldn’t be worth much if you couldn’t find and view the clips you want, right? So Periscope Pro makes it fast and easy. The integrated, one-click Clip Library has a large, full-screen expandable viewing window, complete with clip thumbnails/details in a scrollable frame on the right. It doesn’t get easier – simply click on a clip and it instantly starts running in the viewing window. Not the one you want? No problem – choose another and click it right then and there.

With Periscope Pro you can:

Monitor your home office when you are away

Watch your kids, pets or aging parents

Monitor an office in another city, country or continent

Check on the babysitter or nanny

Keep an eye on your workspace, desk, papers, and your Mac
