Airflow offers you the possibility to stream video content to Apple TV and ChromeCast devices connected to your WiFi network without having to deal with complex configurations. The utility scans the network for available devices and allows you to stream any file that has been previously added to the app’s playlist.



Sophisticated and unique video processing pipeline…

The heart of Airflow. It ensures best possible video quality with lowest CPU load.

How? Airflow transparently remuxes videos that can be remuxed and transcodes videos that need to be transcoded. Transcoding is hardware accelerated if your computer supports it. Sounds too technical? That’s why we built Airflow. It hides all those pesky details and just worksTM.



Great Subtitle supports

Subtitles are important. Unlike most similar software, Airflow doesn’t need to transcode video to display text subtitles. This results in better video quality and lower CPU load. DVD and Bluray subtitles are supported.



Scrubbing preview

Seeking doesn’t have to be a mystery. With instant scrubbing preview you know where you’ll land before the content loads. Also available on Apple TV 4 when scrubbing using touch remote.



Playlists and Last Positions

Lets you organize files into playlists so that watching of multiple episodes is as seamless as it gets.

Compatibility: macOS 10.10 or later 64-bit
