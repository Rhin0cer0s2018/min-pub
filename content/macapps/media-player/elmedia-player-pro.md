Control your streaming in the app. You can play, pause, seek, or stop the video playback. When streaming to Chromecast or DLNA devices you can also adjust the volume in player.

You can also use Elmedia Player as an audio receiver for AirPlay, which comes in handy when you need to stream audio from your phone to a Mac connected to larger speakers.

We have integrated Elmedia Player with opensubtitles.org service, which allows you to find any subtitles available there in a couple of clicks without leaving the player.

Adjust video brightness, contrast, saturation, and more.

Sync subtitles to the video in case it wasn’t in sync originally.

Choose the language for audio and subtitles when files have multiple subtitles and audio streams.
