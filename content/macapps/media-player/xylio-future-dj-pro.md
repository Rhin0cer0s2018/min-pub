future.dj pro (was FutureDecks DJ pro) is our flagship product, packed with the latest professional DJ features that answer the needs of both professional and aspiring DJs. Future.dj pro can easily be used by all manner of DJs, from bedroom DJs who enjoy creating their own mashups and mixes in the comfort of their home, to mobile DJs and club/live DJs that perform in clubs and other live performance conditions. Thanks to an impressive number of advanced and flexible features, there is nothing limiting your creative flow, other than your own creativity.

Mashup tracks, mix videos and make song transitions with the greatest of ease with this classic DJ setup (2-decks and mixer). Thanks to it’s intuitive design and powerful features, you will be able to achieve any level of mixing complexity. You can also sit back and Automix an entire party, simply by activating the powerful Automix function.

What’s New:

Version 1.8.0:

Full Metal support (no longer using OpenGL)

Fully compatible with Music app and macOS Catalina

5 new controllers supported: Reloop Touch (incl the controller 7″ display), Numark DJ2GO2 Touch, 
Hercules Starlight, Hercules Inpulse 200, Hercules Inpulse 300

New Performance PADs modes: PitchCues (aka TonePlay), JumpBeat (skips beats / bars), CueLoop (a 
momentary loop on each cue point)

Extensive optimizations and improvements (your laptop should stay much cooler)

No longer starting in full-screen mode on Mac (but we do recommend you to enter full-screen mode

It looks/works much better)

Fixed access to audio inputs in macOS Catalina (eg. for microphone (karaoke) or turntables (vinyl 
control))

Lots of bug fixes

Compatibility: macOS 10.14 or later, 64-bit processor
