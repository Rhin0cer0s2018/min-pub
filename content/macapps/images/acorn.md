Acorn is a new image editor built with one goal in mind – simplicity. Fast, easy, and fluid, Acorn provides the options you’ll need without any overhead. Acorn feels right, and won’t drain your bank account.

Shape Processor

Shape processors are filters for shape layers which allow you to move, tweak, generate, and adjust shapes. Best of all, the shape processors are non-destructible and stackable just like Acorn’s filters.

Circle Text Tool

Quickly and easily place your text on a circle to create logos and other useful text designs. Modify your text with on-canvas controls for circle radius, rotation, and inversion. Use the baseline and kerning sliders to get things looking just right.

Photoshop Brush Import

Acorn will now import Photoshop brush files (.abr). Just drag and drop the Photoshop brush file onto Acorn to import and make new brushes.

Improved Crop

Trim out parts of your image and even rotate your image while you crop to make the perfect scene. You can even use the crop tool to quickly increase the size of your canvas.

Non-Destructive Levels and Curves

Levels and Curves have joined all the other non-destructive filters in Acorn. You can use Levels and Curves on both bitmap and shape layers, and even save your Curves as a preset for quick editing in the future.

New Filters and Blend Modes

Pin Light and Mask are two of the newest blending modes Acorn has to offer. Acorn also has new filters including Offset, Redraw, and Remove Color Cast, as well as additional options for using filters on selections

Soft Brushes for Clone, Burn, Etc

The Clone, Paint, Smudge, Dodge, Burn, and other tools that work on pixels now have their own super configurable brushes with Acorn’s awesome brush designer. Now you can have scatter for the Clone tool, or adjust flow and softness for the Burn tool. The options are endless.

Snapping

Use Acorn’s snapping to line things up perfectly. Snap to grid, guides, selections, shapes, layers, and the canvas.

Powerful Image Editing

Use non-destructive curves, levels, and filters. Add layer masks and selections to touch up your images or make something entirely

Vector Tools

Stars, arrows, Bézier curves, boolean operations, and text tools are just a few of the vector features awaiting you.

Custom Brushes & More

Acorn includes a built-in brush designer, multi-stop gradients, web export, retina canvas support, and is scriptable and automatable.



Requirements: Intel, 64-bit processor OS X 10.11.4 or later
