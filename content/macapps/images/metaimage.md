MetaImage is the ultimate tool to read, write and edit images metadata. This is first editor that allows you to edit EXIF, IPTC and XMP tags as well as MakerNotes in a beautiful and familiar interface.

The application has been designed to improve your workflow. Users can create and manage presets. Moreover, a special support is provided for geographical and thumbnail data. In addition, displayed tags can be customized via the preferences. In this way, the application fits to your personal needs.

MetaImage is completely integrated to your mac ecosystem. The application even includes a Photos extension. In this way, you can directly inspect your photos from Photos.app.

Supported tags (>5000 tags):

EXIF

IPTC

XMP

ICC Profile

Canon

Leica

FujiFilm

Nikon

Olympus

Panasonic

Pentax

SigmaRaw

Sony

and much more

The application is designed for professional needs. More than 90 image formats are supported 
(HEIC, MOS, CR2, DNG, NEF, NRW, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, RAW, and much more). MakerNotes tags may be 
edited but not created or deleted. This avoids many potential problems with OEM software.


Additional features:

Export tags to CSV and JSON

Export embedded thumbnails

Export embedded jpeg from raw

Copy/Paste multiple tags

Support password-protected images

Support notifications and touch bar

Support folder processing (* except HEIC files *)

This version has been optimized for macOS High Sierra and later. Moreover the application is available in 7 languages (English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Japanese and Chinese).

Feedbacks can be sent directly from the application. In this way, you can contact us for any kind of suggestions and improvements in few clics.

MetaImage is accompanied by other applications.

SnapMotion: extract still images from videos with precision.

GlueMotion: edit, deflicker and assemble images into time lapse.
