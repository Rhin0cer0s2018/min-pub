Artista Haiku will add spontaneity to your pictures. This creative media incorporates traditional techniques as well as the non-traditional such as digital photography, and vintage papers to create a unique painting filled with movement and meaning.

To capture the atmospheric mysteries in your scene try reducing the outline to the scantiest detail, and reducing the color to dabs of accent, your painting will convey the essence of poetry in that scene whether weighty or substantial as in a building façade or an open body of water.
