Hydra lets you create beautiful high-dynamic-range (HDR) images by merging multiple exposures, effectively capturing both dark and bright subjects to make it more natural, or to enhance scene drama. A single photo cannot represent the entire dynamic range of light in a scene, due to the physical limitations of the sensor.

Hydra allows you to overcome this limitation by merging a number of photos with different exposure settings, and to create a natural image that is much closer to what your eyes actually see. Alternatively, Hydra can also artistically push contrasts to increase drama and emotion in your pictures beyond reality. This new release of Hydra has been optimized for latest macOS enhancements, and it provides native Metal support with maximum performance, in addition to a more modern and simpler user interface.
