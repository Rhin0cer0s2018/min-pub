Image Basket

Gather and hold images from different locations or folders in the Image Basket. Once you have your desired assortment, you can use any of the tools or features in ACDSee to view or edit these files.

Filter By

Quickly single out and display files by their metadata, such as ratings, color labels, tags, and categories. This essential component of digital asset management will also identify images by the metadata they don’t have, such as “no keywords”, “untagged”, and “uncategorized”.

Compare Images

Highlight the similarities and the differences in up to four images at once with the Compare Images tool. Use zooming and panning to identify which images to keep.

Auto Advance

Manage entire folders without ever moving your hands from the keyboard. With Auto Advance, adding metadata will move the focus to the next image in the File List pane, allowing you to seamlessly organize.

External Editors

Easily configure ACDSee to work with a variety of other image editors. Specify a default editor, and then promptly open images in other applications right from inside Manage or View mode.

Multiple Databases

Create as many ACDSee databases as you like, and swiftly and smoothly switch between them.

Batch Add Watermark

Claim your work by adding watermarks to your images. Adjust size, position, and opacity for the perfect signature, and save your settings as a preset. Apply it to one, many, or all.

Batch Add Border

Frame your favorite photos in batches with the Batch Add Border tool. Customize the color, texture, and thickness of your border, and choose from nearly 100 unique edges to complement your shots.

Import Database

Don’t lose hours of cataloging just because you want the latest software. Import your database from version 3 or 4 of ACDSee Photo Studio Mac and keep right on working.
