JixiPix Dramatic Black & White Supercharged Retro Sophisticated Simple uber Cool Dramatic Black & White was too long a name for the software stores, so we were forced to edit it down.

Everyone knows it doesn’t get better than classic Black & White—it is the artistic soul of photography. Referencing one of our favorite Ansel Adams quotes: “Great Black & White photos aren’t taken—they’re made”. Using Dramatic Black & White, you can make your own black and white photographs, ones where light and contrast, grit and form come together to tell a story; where stone and sky, water and light transcend the material world and ascend to the Photographers’ Gallery.

With Dramatic Black & White there are no mistakes you can’t fix, no limits to your vision, no stopping until you’re finished, nothing to hold you back from truly making your photos—”Oh.My.Gosh”. good!
