Nevercenter CameraBag Pro 2020 The best kept secret in photography (and videography) just got a whole lot better! CameraBag lets you instantly apply one of hundreds of beautiful presets to your photos and videos, and then dive deeper with ultra-intuitive professional adjustments and custom presets. CameraBag’s focus on intuitive tools and workflows isn’t about dumbing down image editing, it’s about making it work better.

With presets specifically designed for portraits, different landscape scenarios, faithful emulation of analog film stock from the past, popular modern photo styles, and more, CameraBag has you covered, even if you don’t yet know how to use all of its powerful tools.

CameraBag Pro is particularly great for anyone who needs to apply the same style to both photos and videos – especially with batch processing for large sets of media (including watermarks/branding, resizing, and cropping).

For those with professional needs, what really sets CameraBag apart from other photo editors is just how intuitive and powerful its advanced tools are.

Unique curve tools, adjustment re-ordering and layering, and large precise controls let you do things you simply can’t do in other popular software.

Following are some ways CameraBag is perfect for specific groups of users.

Wedding Photography

Easy batch filtering and watermarking

Use the exact same adjustments and filters on videos and photos

Quick comparison tools for large sets of photos

Tons of useful presets for wedding photography

*** CameraBag Pro includes all the same great features as CameraBag Photo, but also works on videos and includes LUT file support! ***
