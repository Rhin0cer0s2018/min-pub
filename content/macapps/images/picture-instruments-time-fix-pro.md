Picture Instruments Time Fix Pro It may well happen that the time in your camera was not set correctly or that you forgot to set the correct time zone on your last trip. At some point it is no longer clear, when the pictures were shot. If the pictures were shot with several cameras and you wish to combine all pictures in the right order, even a few minutes offset between the cameras can cause a big chaos.

Compatibility: OS X 10.9 or later 64-bit
