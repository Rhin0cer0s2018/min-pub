GlueMotion is the perfect tool for photographers lapse of time. The application allows you to edit batch Deflicker and assemble sequences of images in time – lapse movies.

GlueMotion is the perfect tool for time lapse photographers. The application allows you to batch edit, deflicker and assemble sequences of images into time lapse movies.

GlueMotion has been made to save your time and guide you during the process of creation. By using the included batch editing tool, you will not have to use additional applications. GlueMotion is able to crop, rotate, flip and adjust colors of your photos such as exposure, saturation or brightness. Moreover the application is able to deflicker the sequences of photos. In other words, GlueMotion will analyze your photos and select automatically the optimal brightness correction for each image.

The application is designed for professional needs. That is why it can handle several hundreds of thousands of images painlessly. In addition, all industry-standard formats are supported. The application can import PNG, JPEG as well as all RAW image formats supported by macOS. The exported movie can be encoded in H.264, Apple ProRes as well as HEVC.
