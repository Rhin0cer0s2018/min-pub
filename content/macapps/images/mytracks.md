myTracks is the swiss-army knife for organizing your GPS tracks. They can be loaded from a broad range of devices and organized in a library comfortably.

Once imported you can drag & drop photo files to myTracks and they will be assigned to the GPS tracks automatically. The GPS information can be written to the EXIF and IPTC tags of the photo files (Geotagging). You can use any photo organizing software such as Photos, iPhoto, Aperture, Lightroom, GraphicConverter or even the Finder. myTracks can handle both JPEG and RAW file formats.

GPS tracks can be exported as GPX, KML or KMZ files. You can use the exported files, e.g. with Google Earth.

Besides the dedicated GPS loggers a free iPhone App called “myTracks – The GPS logger” is available on the App Store. You can use this App to record GPS tracks.

Using iCloud you can easily synchronise all your tracks between all your devices (iOS and macOS).

See the supporting website for more screenshots, screencasts and the complete list of supported loggers.
