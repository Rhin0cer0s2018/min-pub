To keep your painting organized and in control, we give Layers and selective color tool useful for defining areas for accurate brushing. Both professional functions are designed to keep the color where you want.

The key is simplicity, light tinted photograph each project, scrapbook or craft a nostalgic and timeless quality to every project we love it lends.
