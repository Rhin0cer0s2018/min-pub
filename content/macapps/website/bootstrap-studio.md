Bootstrap Studio A powerful desktop app for creating responsive websites using the Bootstrap framework.

Bootstrap Studio is a powerful desktop app for designing and prototyping websites.

It comes with a large number of built-in components, which you can drag and drop to assemble responsive web pages. The app is built on top of the hugely popular Bootstrap framework, and exports clean and semantic HTML.

The Interface

Bootstrap Studio has a beautiful and powerful interface, which is built around the simplicity of drag and drop. This makes it the perfect tool for prototyping and designing web pages and apps.

Beautiful Templates

The app comes with a number of premium, fully responsive templates that you can customize. Each template consists of multiple pages and widgets you can pick-and-match into the perfect website.

Beautiful Components

Bootstrap Studio comes with a large number of pretty components for building responsive pages. We've got headers, footers, galleries, slideshows and even basic elements like spans and divs. See some of them below.

Realtime Preview

Bootstrap Studio has a powerful feature called Preview. With it, you can open your design in multiple web browsers and devices, and every change you make within the app will be shown instantaneously everywhere.

Editing Code

For some things drag and drop isn't enough. This is why Bootstrap Studio gives you full control over your markup when you need it. You can import and edit CSS, SASS, JavaScript and HTML in our Sublime Text-like editor.
