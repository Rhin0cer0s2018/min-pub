Sparkle is the easiest way to make a real website. It’s the smart choice that helps you build a website that delivers. Cost effectively, on your Mac.

THE SMART CHOICE

Sparkle combines an uncompromising visual approach, freeform design and a delightful interface. All in a powerful Mac app. Nothing else
comes close.

You gave up on HTML, on tools that aren’t quite visual enough or are full of jargon, on cookie cutter templates.




Sparkle turns your design into a live site on the fly.


WEBSITE THAT DELIVERS

You want your site to stand out, to sell more, get more reservations and signups, be more authoritative. This is the performance that
matters. Put your voice in it, your personal touch. It’s you, Sparkle and the open web.

You can count on Sparkle producing fast loading, high ranking sites.



COST EFFECTIVELY

There’s no shortcut to uniqueness. Only hard work and iteration make your website stand out in a world of templates.

Cost isn’t the cash you pay. It’s the time spent fighting themes and plugins, confusing and overlapping in function.



Sparkle is effortless, it makes change fast, iteration fun.



ON YOUR MAC

We love our Mac like you love yours, and we love the superior feel of native applications. Sparkle is a modern, slick Mac application. It
supports the latest Mac hardware and software features, like the Touch Bar and Dark Mode.

Sparkle’s familiar interface fits right in on your Mac and integrates with other apps. Sparkle was born on macOS and is optimized for
Mojave.



Sparkle is backed by a product-focused company praised for its support and helpfulness.
