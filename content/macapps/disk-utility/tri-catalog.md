Tri-CATALOG analyzes and catalogues an unlimited number of volumes. If you spend too much time finding a picture or a file on your hard disk or your CDs, just let Tri-CATALOG analyze them once, and you’ll recover them in a wink. Tri-CATALOG was build to save a list of the contents of your folders, local and remote disks, CDs, DVDs, etc., in its database so that you can locate them quickly and easily.

Share your pictures: For each folder or disk analyzed, Tri-CATALOG creates a “virtual volume” containing the list of files and folder hierarchy, as well as thumbnails for images. With Tri-CATALOG, you can easily share this data with other users and other Macs.

Protect your pictures: You can send “virtual volumes” to others. They can view your images but with limited resolution. You retain control of the original pictures.

Bring your whole photo library with you: The “virtual volumes” are very light compared to the original volume, but you can see all the images (reduced). On a small Mac, you can view all of your pictures.

A very easy way to manage pictures and files. If you spend too much time finding a picture or a file on your hard disk or your CDs, just let Tri-CATALOG analyze them once, and you’ll recover them in a wink. Tri-CATALOG was build to save a list of the contents of your folders, local and remote disks, CDs, DVDs, etc., in its database so that you can locate them quickly and easily. Share your pictures

For each folder or disk analyzed, Tri-CATALOG creates a “virtual volume” containing the list of files and folder hierarchy, as well as thumbnails for images. With Tri-CATALOG, you can easily share this data with other users and other Macs.

Protect your pictures

You can send “virtual volumes” to others. They can view your images but with limited resolution. You retain control of the original pictures.

Bring your whole photo library with you

The “virtual volumes” are very light compared to the original volume, but you can see all the images (reduced). On a small Mac, you can view all of your pictures.

The creation of “virtual volumes”

Tri-CATALOG can analyze the content of any volume (disk, partition, CD, DVD, USB key, etc.) or folder. It creates a “virtual volume” containing the list of files and folders in the hierarchical organization, and the views of all the images (as thumbnails).

You can create an unlimited number of “virtual volumes”. These “virtual volumes” remain accessible at all times, even if the original disk is no longer available. So you can keep all the content you want in your database while using only a limited space.

Browse the “virtual volumes”

All “virtual volumes” that you have created are available at any time, even if the original disk is no longer available. You can browse their contents, view images and read the information (file attributes, EXIF and IPTC data of images, etc.). The main window displays a list of all volumes analyzed (left), the contents of the selected volume and images.

Search the “virtual volumes”

If you need to find an image or file, search in the data base on some or all of the volumes saved. Tri-CATALOG can show you the pictures you want to retrieve, and will tell you where and in what device the original item is saved.

Share the “virtual volumes”

For each volume, there is a file “virtual volume” created in the database.

Tri-CATALOG use as image server

From the browser window showing a volume, you can directly use the images, whether they are on your hard drive or server, make a copy or drag and drop to other applications (mail software, website editor, etc..). All the images are directly accessible and usable for your work or creation.

Use Tri-CATALOG in READER mode

Tri-CATALOG can be used in consultation only (Reader). All volumes are available from the data base with the display and research functions, but the user can not modify the data base.

Compatibility: Intel, OS X 10.6 or later
