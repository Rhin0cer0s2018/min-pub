SMART Utility is an application to scan the internal hardware diagnostics system of hard drives. SMART (Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology) is a system built into hard drives by their manufacturers to report on various measurements (called attributes) of a hard drive’s operation. The attributes can be used to detect when a hard drive is having mechanical or electrical problems, and can indicate when the hard drive is dying. This allows time to hopefully backup, and then replace the drive.

FEATURES

Displays all supported internal drives and their partitions, as well as some external drives (if optional SAT SMART driver is installed)

Displays important information in the main window, such as drive model, capacity, power on hours, temperature, bad sector counts, and error counts and types

Displays easy to read overall SMART status with color coded text

Displays more detailed information in separate windows, including capabilities, all available attributes, and the past five errors

Displays information using the Growl notification service (if installed) and email notifications (if configured)

Displays information in menu bar

Supports scanning in the background

Supports running a hard drive’s built-in test, and displays the results of the test

Supports scanning OS X software RAID drives, as well as drives in many RAID enclosures and cards (including SeriTek drives)

Supports logging all information to a log file for verifying SMART data

Supports customizing the pre-fail algorithm, including only alerting new bad sectors and error counts

Supports saving drive reports for later viewing

Supports printing drive reports

Supports HDDs and SSDs

Supports Mac OS X 10.9 through 10.14
