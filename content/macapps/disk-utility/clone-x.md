Clone X is specially designed to create a copy of your system, to duplicate it on other disks or computers, and to repair and reinstall the system in case of problems (damaged system, errors during installation, etc.)

With OS X, the system is now a very complex construction. It is no longer confined within the System 9 System folder, but is distributed all around multiple folders, most of them being inaccessible (invisible, protected or permission denied). Moreover, any copy or installation must preserve permissions and ownership of each file.

Clone your System: Clone X provides powerful features to analyze your system (OS X and OS 9), to execute a full copy (a clone) of your System, even if the system was installed and updated many times with the updaters provided by Apple. The clone is saved on an external drive, CD-R as well as a part of your internal disk. The clone is compressed to save disk space, and you can create as many clones as you need.

Repair your System: Starting from this clone, Clone X will be able at any time to repair your system if damaged, or if some data was lost, or an installation has corrupted your system. Youâ€™ll have your system back to its original state. Repair operation is undoable!

Recreate identical systems on other disks: With the copy of your original system realized by Clone X, you can install a similar system on other disks or other computers, preserving your own configuration and settings.



(Mac OS X 10.6 or later)
