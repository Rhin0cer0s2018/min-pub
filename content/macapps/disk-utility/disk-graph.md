Disk Graph is a tool that allows you to inspect your disk and easily find the files that take away most of your disk space. With its beautiful interface and its pie-like graph, locating big files has never been easier.

Features of DiskGraph include:

● any directory reachable in the Finder (i.e. on your local machine, on an external drive or even on a remote server) can be selected and immediately analyzed

● freely navigate inside the subdirectories of an analyzed folder or device

● smooth animations manage the transitions between selected directories

● move the mouse over a file to see its name and size

● use the context menu to trash selected files

● quickly search for filenames

● save your favorite locations and access them with one click from the main window.

Compatibility: macOS 10.7 or later
