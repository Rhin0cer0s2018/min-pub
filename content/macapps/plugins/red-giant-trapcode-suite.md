Red Giant Trapcode Suite – the industry-standard package for motion graphics in After Effects. Red Giant Trapcode Suite is a set of 11 tools for 3D motion graphics and visual effects.

Particle Effects Trapcode Suite brings the power of 3D particle systems right into After Effects. Use particle emitters to create fire, water, smoke, snow, and other organic visual effects, or create technological marvels and user interfaces with immortal particle grids and 3D forms. Combine multiple particle systems into one unified 3D space for visually stunning results. With GPU acceleration, Trapcode plugins help you get beautiful results fast.

Physics & Fluids For the first time ever, run realistic fluid simulations using the new Dynamic Fluids™ physics engine or emulate particles moving through the air and bouncing off surfaces.

3D Objects & Surfaces Create flowing surfaces, mountainous terrains, endless tunnels, and abstract shapes. Use paths and motion to generate beautifully complex geometric shapes, ribbons, and extrusions. Whether you are creating motion graphics or visual effects, the possibilities are endless.

Lights and Glimmers Bring light and life into your motion design. Simulate organic, 3D-camera aware of volumetric lighting. Use masks and paths to add light streaks that can bring your logos and text to life and add starry glimmers to accent the highlights in your work.

Sound and Motion Use audio to generate keyframes that drive animation and effects. Scale, rotate and move to the beat, or use drum hits to create particle effects. Duplicate and offset layers and their motion with ease. Trapcode Suite gives you the power to automate complex animation easily.
