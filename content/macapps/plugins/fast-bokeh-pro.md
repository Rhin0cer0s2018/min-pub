Fast Bokeh is a plug-in for After Effects that creates a smooth Depth of Field bokeh blur using a Depth Map. It’s very fast, handles edges properly and easy to use.

Blur Radius Independent

Fast Bokeh’s performance only depends on the image size, but not the amount of blur applied, so you can expect a near constant render performance.

No Hard Edges

Object boundaries are expanded and edges are handled properly as expected. There are still limits because the plug-in doesn’t have information about occluded objects in the render, but it does a reasonable job in avoiding hard edges and halos as much as possible.

Smooth Fast Blur

This plug-in creates a smooth Guassian-like fast blur. No special aperture shapes or chromatic aberration settings. So it’s consistent across all dynamic color ranges.

32 bit colors

32 bpc is not only supported, but also recommended for best quality.
