Get ready to have your mind (and ears) blown. IK Multimedia AmpliTube a major upgrade to the world’s most powerful guitar and bass tone studio for Mac/PC, is here and will take you to a level of hyper-realism and customization of tone you never knew possible.

AmpliTube 4 is a study of guitar and bass for Mac / PC that functions as a standalone application and as a complement to your favorite DAW. AmpliTube recreates the entire signal chain guitar / bass from the instrument to the recording device, and does so in a very realistic and intuitive way. But also does it in ways you never dreamed possible.

If you are new to using computers to get a fabulous guitar tone, then you are looking for a treatment. If you’re a veteran computer master tones, well, you’re still looking for a gift. AmpliTube pioneered and leads the way in modeling amps and guitar effects, and AmpliTube 4 carries it to the outer edges of the end hyperrealism with intuitive familiar tools.

Fasten your seat belts … let ‘s make a quick tour!
