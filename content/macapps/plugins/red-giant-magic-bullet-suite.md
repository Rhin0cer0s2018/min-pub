Red Giant Magic Bullet Suite – Color correction, finishing and film looks for filmmakers. Magic Bullet Suite is a set of seven tools that bring intuitive, real time color correction, and beyond, right to your editorial timeline.

Color Correct

Magic Bullet Suite 13 gives you everything you need to make your footage look great, right on your editing timeline. Balance out your shots with powerful color adjustments that work the way your eye expects them to. Then, go beyond color correction, with accurate simulations of lens filters and film stocks. With Magic Bullet Suite, you’ll have the most powerful and intuitive real time color correction tools available, without ever needing to switch to a different app.

Stylize

Give your footage the look of a Hollywood film. With the tools in Magic Bullet Suite, your footage can instantly have cinematic contrast and the sophisticated color palettes of big budget movies. With tons of fully customizable presets based on popular movies and TV shows, you will have beautiful results in seconds.

Refine

Quickly balance skin tones, reduce wrinkles and remove skin blemishes, so your talent can look their best. Magic Bullet Suite makes cosmetic cleanup fast and easy, and gives you natural results that look untouched.

Cleanup

Save your footage from video noise caused by shooting in the dark or at high ISOs. Magic Bullet Suite can clean up the noise while still preserving the details in your shot. At the end of your color grading process, Magic Bullet Suite can also reintroduce some subtle texture and a natural film grain that gives your final product a look that feels genuine and unprocessed.

COMPATIBILITY

Magic Bullet Suite is made up of several different tools that each have their own compatibility info. Every tool runs on Mac and Windows and is compatible with Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects and Apple Final Cut Pro X, while some of the tools also work in additional host-applications
