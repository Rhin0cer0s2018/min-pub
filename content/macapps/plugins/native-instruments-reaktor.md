REAKTOR 6 is the ultimate creative toolkit for deep sound exploration, featuring cutting-edge DSP and high-fidelity sound.

INTRODUCING BLOCKS

Blocks is a new framework that turns REAKTOR 6 into a fully-equipped, rack-style modular synth. Over 30 Blocks – including oscillators,
filters, effects, modulators, and sequencers – come with REAKTOR 6. Among these Blocks are components from acclaimed NI synths such as
ROUNDS and MONARK – all you need to start creating elaborate modular synth patches.



GET CONNECTED

REAKTOR 6 delivers extensive connectivity for any setup. MIDI, OSC, and CV/Gate connectivity lets you connect hardware modular systems, standalone hardware, other software instruments, and mobile devices. From simple hardware/software setups to elaborate, custom performance systems, REAKTOR 6 is your central hub for creativity.

UNRIVALLED SOUND QUALITY

REAKTOR’s trademark sound quality is unmistakable. From anti-aliased oscillators and ZDF (zero delay feedback) filters to granular synthesis engines, a team of leading developers build every component in REAKTOR from the core level up using the most elegant algorithms. Their relentless pursuit of DSP excellence keeps this sonic toolkit at the head of its class. And everything inside is organized for immediate use in REAKTOR’s macro libraries for fast, creative building sessions.

FOR SOUND MAKERS OF ALL LEVELS

Newcomers can quickly start playing with over 70 REAKTOR Factory instruments, each loaded with presets to get you started. Or download one of over 4,000 free instruments created by the REAKTOR user community. Once the REAKTOR environment becomes familiar, patching with Blocks unlocks a world of on-the-fly sonic experimentation.
