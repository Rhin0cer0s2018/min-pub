Mettle FreeForm Pro Turn your After Effects layer into so much more: terrain, morphing organic shapes, an array of primitives, water simulation, character animation.

Pro-Level 3D Mesh Warp Plug-in for After Effects. Create and animate terrains, water, billowing fabric, backgrounds in After Effects. Great for character animation, shape morphing, and much more!

Complex layer deformations in 3D space using Mesh Warp, Displacement Mapping and many Render options. Great for transforming your footage into 3D shapes (incl. Points, Planes, Primitives-cubes-terahedrons, Wireframe). Intuitive Character animation. Shape morphing. Terrain creation. Water simulation. Organic backgrounds. And much more.

Three main tool sets: Mesh Warp, Displacement Mapping and Render Primitives.

PRIMITIVES

Transform your layer into an array of primitives: Cubes, Tetrahedrons, Octahedrons, Icosahedrons, Rods and Planes.

Controls to Amplify Scale and Rotation via luminance values in height maps.

Assign Ae layers (including animated pre-comps) as a texture.

Time Sampling Controls (Random Still Frame & Random Loop).

Transform Controls: Scale, Rotation and Anchor Point (X,Y,Z).

Randomize Postion and Rotation (X,Y,Z).


SKYDOME

Display and render a separate Environment Map or use your Reflection Map as the background.


Field of View Controls.

Mist and Fog are cast onto SkyDome Background.


NEW DISPLACEMENT MAPPING CONTROLS

Displacement Bias and Smooth Normals

SCREEN SPACE REFRACTION

CONTOUR OPTIMIZED

Pre-Blur: Texture Map and/or Displacement Map.


Enhanced support of Alpha Channels – Use Texture Layer’s Alpha and/or Displacement Layers Alpha.

NEW RENDER OPTIONS

Normals, UV, Shadows, X-ray and Points.

Shadows cast on Normals and UV.

THE GENERATOR

Replicate your 3D object multiple times on a single layer. Control and animate the replications with one set of controls.

3D DISPLACEMENT MAPPING

Use a grayscale image to displace or deform your layer in 3D space. Great for terrain and character animation.

FRESNEL

Add the fresnel lens phenomenon to your work. Create additional 3D materials, like water and glass.

DISPLACEMENT MAP CHANNELS

Isolate different regions on your 3D model, and give them different reflections and finishes.

DISPLACEMENT MAP NOISE

Easier to create natural-looking organic surfaces and animations using mathematical algorithms instead of additional geometry. Is a great complement to displacement maps.
