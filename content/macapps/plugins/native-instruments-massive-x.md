Native Instruments Massive X new flagship synth, built by the same team as its predecessor. Based on a state of the art architecture, it delivers pristine sound, and huge creative flexibility for artists and sound designers alike – allowing them to create, modulate, and experiment with sound from a huge range of sources, in any way they like.

Release Notes:

• MASSIVE X is only available as AAX, AU, VST Plug-ins in this version. MASSIVE X requires an AVX compatible CPU to install and run. The MASSIVE X Factory Library is a separate installation, be sure to install via NATIVE ACCESS.

• FIXED VST/AU: Projects saved without a preset name using earlier versions of Massive X will now load the saved sound instead of the init preset

Please note: MASSIVE X requires an AVX-compatible CPU to run.

MASSIVE X does not currently run in standalone mode.

Install Notes:

Just install and enjoy!
