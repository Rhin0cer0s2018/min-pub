apulSoft apTrigga3 is an audio plugin to play back audio samples based on trigger events generated from the audio input signal level. It has advanced sample management features and can record samples from the input. Sample selection, level, pitch and an output filter can be modulated by the signal level.

apTrigga3 features an input filter section with a built in frequency analyzer and an unlimited number of configureable filter bands to shape the input signal.

apTrigga3 has various playback modes to select samples in sequence, by random or to play them back at the same time. Samples can be visually cropped right inside the plugin window.

Use apTrigga3 to replace or mix drum sounds on single-instrument channels. Due to its zero sample latency it works great for live drum triggering.

FIXED : Keygen does not work due to the last update for apShaper.
