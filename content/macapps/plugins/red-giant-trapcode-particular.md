Create effects of organic particles and 3D graphics elements complex motion in After Effects. Now with Fluid Dynamics.

Motion graphics

Trapcode Particular is a plugin for After Effects that allows you to add particles to your compositions to your motion graphics to life. Use 3D objects for even more beauty and complexity.

VISUALS

Create fire, water, smoke, snow, and other organic effects. Combine multiple particle systems in 3D space unified for visually stunning results.

PHYSICS

For the first time, run simulations realistic fluids with new physics engine Dynamic â„¢ Fluids, or emulates particles moving through the air and bounce off the surfaces.

DESIGNER

Trapcode Particular gives you the ability to create particle effects visually, with a powerful designer who makes generating effects more creative and intuitive than ever.

PRESETS

Choose from more than 335 presets for Trapcode Particular, designed to give you an edge. Each preset is fully customizable.


CHARACTERISTICS

Trapcode Particular has been redesigned to include many new features and improvements.

DESIGNER (NEW)

Creating particle effects is easier than ever, in the updated Designer. Add adjustable blocks behaviors and presets for emitting particles, physical and auxiliary particles. Or add effects and
customizable full particles with one click.

FLUID DYNAMICS (NEW)

Create dynamic effects swirl with new physics engine Dynamic Fluids, allowing the particles to behave as moving through real fluids. Choose from 4 customizable fluidic behavior.

GPU-ACCELERATED

Get quick feedback with the new GPU acceleration Trapcode Particular via OpenGL. Depending on the system configuration, you could see speed increases up to 4X or more previous releases.

CAMERA AND LIGHTS 3D

uses including 3D camera and lights in After Effects so you can fully integrate their particle effects with motion graphics and VFX live action shots.

INSTANT FEEDBACK

The designer provides instant visual feedback, making the creation and preview the effect is an intuitive and creative experience. New in particular 3, the designer respects the size of the AE
composition, providing the composition and camera information. Preview particle design with the position controls of the camera and the emitter

multiple systems

For the first time, explore endless creative possibilities when combining multiple particle systems in the same 3D space. Create beautiful and complex effects through the interaction of
different systems, all within an instance of Particular. Issuers in multisystem configurations can share parameter settings (such as turbulence, and gravity), and can be stored as a single
preset.

OBJS AS ISSUERS

Give your particle systems using a new dimension 3D models and animated sequences OBJ as particle emitters. For flexibility, it can choose to emit particles from the vertices, edges, faces or
volume of the OBJ file. Choose from the library of over 60 OBJ Particular, or easily upload your own models using the new Panel OBJ load directly into After Effects or within the Designer.

SPRITE and polygons

Use any of its composition and particle assigning a 2D or textured polygon sprite. Particular 3 now includes over 270 images of still and animated sprite, which easily loaded directly in After
Effects Designer or through the new panel load Sprite.

SHADOWS AND ILLUMINATION

Shading all types of particle lights in After Effects. Shading can emulate the decrease in light, and rendering Shadowlet can generate shadows both main and aux particles.

THE REBOUND AND PHYSICAL

Move organic particles through the air, or bounce from other layers, with a Particular physics engine. Controls include wind, gravity, turbulence and to simulate more complex and realistic
movements.

AUXILIARY SYSTEM

It generates new child particles through the Aux Particular system. Create organic paths and branches, or create splash after a rebound. The auxiliary system updated owners 3 now includes the
ability to add customized for even greater variation particles and keyframe parameters for more control.

PRESET 335 PLUS (NEW)

Start running with more than 335 presets Fully customizable designer. Particular 4 includes more than 35 new presets showing powerful features such as fluid dynamics and more. Explore the
library to find beautifully designed to create fluid effects, fire, space flight, fireworks, flashes, explosions, smoke and more. Save your own presets and share them on site.

Reflection maps
Create dynamic color changes its particles using a textured polygon layer as a reflection map. Flashes added to the particles as they rotate in 3D.
