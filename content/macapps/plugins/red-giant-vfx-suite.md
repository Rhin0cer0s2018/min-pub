Red Giant VFX offers a powerful toolkit for realistic visual effects composites in After Effects. With Supercomp, light and atmospheric effects interact with all of your layers and the elements of a scene in a far more natural way than can be modeled with a simple stack of 2D layers. VFX Suite also includes tools for adding shado

Chroma Key

Red Giant VFX gives you fast, automatic chroma keying. Whether you are using a green screen or blue screen, Primatte Keyer can regularly pull a perfect key with a single click. Primatte’s cleanup tools help turn even the most difficult shots into solid and professional composites. Take your chroma keying results even further by using Primatte in combination with Supercomp’s post-keying tools.

Tracking & Cleanup

VFX Suite features lighting-fast, accurate planar tracking, right inside of After Effects — no need to step out of AE for great corner-pin tracking results anymore. Whether you’re pinning a rectangular sign or something not rectangular at all, King Pin Tracker has you covered. Also included is Spot Clone Tracker, a powerful tool for quickly removing anything from skin blemishes to unwanted objects in your shot.

Lights & Glows

VFX Suite’s Optical Glow generates a blazing fast, drop-dead gorgeous, photo-realistic glow effect — great for use in visual effects and motion graphics. It’s easy to use and is by far the most beautiful, highest-quality glow ever made for Adobe After Effects. Knoll Light Factory gives you 3D lens flares from Industrial Light and Magic, and includes over 200 presets based on films from the 1960’s to the present day.

Distortion

VFX Suite makes it easy to generate beautiful prismatic displacement effects for visual effects and motion graphics. Unlike the Displacement Map effect in After Effects, Chromatic Displacement uses the displacement image as a height map, which gives you beautiful, organic results — perfect for creating force fields, heat ripples, light refractions, cloaking effects, and much more.

VFX Supercomp

Supercomp is a compositing environment that makes it easy to create complex, seamless composites. In Supercomp, light and atmospheric effects interact with ALL of your layers and the elements of a scene in a far more natural way and with far less pre-composing than ever before. Supercomp includes more than 15 gpu-accelerated context-aware tools for integrating all of your elements into your final shot.

VFX Primatte Keyer

Primatte Keyer is a powerful tool for fast, automatic chroma keying. Whether you are using a green screen or blue screen, Primatte Keyer’s auto compute algorithms can often pull a perfect key automatically. The new user interface and clean up tools make it easy to select and separate your background and foreground.

VFX King Pin Tracker

King Pin Tracker gives you fast, accurate planar tracking, right inside of After Effects. King Pin Tracker makes it simple to place signs or objects into a shot, even if they aren’t simple rectangular shapes. With powerful To and From pins, and the ability to offset and rotate in planar space, you can pin whatever you want, wherever you want it.

VFX Spot Clone Tracker

Spot Clone Tracker is a tool for lightning-fast, simple object removal with a built-in tracker for moving footage. Easily fix blemishes or remove small, unwanted items. Spot Clone Tracker is easy to use, and even matches your lighting automatically, with options for how it clones light, color and texture.

VFX Optical Glow

Optical Glow is a blazing fast, drop-dead gorgeous, photo-realistic glow effect for use in professional visual effects and motion graphics. It’s easily the most beautiful, highest-quality glow you’ve ever had on your timeline. There’s actually a lot of science behind why it looks so much better than the glows you’ve been using for years, but the bottom line is it’s just super awesome.

VFX Chromatic Displacement

Chromatic Displacement uses one layer to displace the pixels of another, while smoothly separating out the colors. Unlike the Displacement Map effect in After Effects, Chromatic Displacement uses the displacement image as a height map, which gives you beautiful, organic results. We designed Chromatic Displacement for creating professional visual effects, such as force fields, heat ripples, light refractions, cloaking effects, and much more – but it’s also great for motion graphics.

VFX Knoll Light Factory

Designed by John Knoll, Chief Creative Officer at Industrial Light and Magic, Knoll Light Factory creates camera-inspired, photo-realistic lens flares that render fast, thanks to new GPU acceleration. Using the intuitive Lens Editor, create your own flares from scratch, or customize one of the 200 included presets inspired by some of the most iconic films of the past few decades.

VFX Shadow

Shadow is a plugin for After Effects that makes it super easy to add a perspective shadow in front of or behind a layer, based on its alpha channel, brightness, and more. With options for softness, bend, length, color and many other properties, the Shadow effect goes far beyond the various shadow tools available inside After Effects.

VFX Reflection

Reflection is a plugin for After Effects that makes it easy to add a reflection to your layers. With controls for softness, distance fade, length and more, this effect goes far beyond the standard methods for creating reflections.
