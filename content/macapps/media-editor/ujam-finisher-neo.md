UJAM Finisher Neo Infinite Instant InspirationBoldly going where no audio effect has gone before.

Inspiration & Creative Control

Finisher is a new concept of audio plug-ins, designed to deliver the power and flexibility of a full rack of audio processors and effects with the instant gratification and not a steep learning
curve that UJAM products are famous for.

What’s in There?

Pro-grade audio effect plug-in

27 algorithms from granular pitch to multi-band distortion

50 Modes – complex multi-effect chains made by pro sound designers

Uber – easy operation via macro controls

Futuristic FX

NEO stands for the forward-thinking and bold exploration of new frontiers, that’s exactly what this plug-in is about. It’s the first of its kind in the world, and a sheer endless source of
inspiration for modern, epic, action-packed and thrilling audio effects.

Features at a Glance

Finisher NEO comes with 50 carefully sound-designed effect configurations built from 27 different algorithms – from Grain Pitch to Multiband Distortion, from simple Stereo Delays to
Convolution. Three macro knobs give you full control without the hassle. Tweak or automate the Effect knob for musically stunning sonic shifts, and adjust Variation and Ambience to make every
effect your own.

Variation 1

The Variation knob lets you adjust musically useful changes to the current Mode – switch delay times, set EQ characteristics, change distortion curves and much more, often at the same time.

Variation 2

Most Finisher NEO effects come with a matching ambiance, and this knob lets you change its mix, length, character – whatever puts your track where it belongs in the mix.
