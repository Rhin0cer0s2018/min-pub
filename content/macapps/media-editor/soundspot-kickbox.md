SoundSpot KickBox 1.0.2a The kick drum is the backbone of many modern music genres, both electronic and acoustic. It’s Often times the thing you start with in a new mix, but to get
it sounding just right can be a complex task.



A well mixed kick drum has a warm sounding low end, doesn’t sound too boxy and pierces through the mix in a very natural way. When designing KickBox, these are the qualities we’ve
focused on, simplifying the mixing process for any modern kick drum.



The KickBox is modelled after analogue filters and separates the relevant frequency ranges in a very transparent way. KickBox can help you get your kicks sounding extremely tight in
a matter of just a few clicks.



KickBox can be used directly on both mono and stereo tracks. For most electronic kicks it is best used first or early in your mixing chain. For live recorded acoustic kicks however,
it can be beneficial to use a shelving equaliser to achieve a general frequency balance before applying KickBox.



We designed the KickBox for kick drum processing, but as there are no rules in music, we decided to experiment with other source materials and discovered it also has many other
interesting uses when used on other low end instruments like bass guitar, toms and other types of percussion. Why not experiment a little yourself.



Features:

+ Fast and intuitive workflow.

+ Analog modeled filters.

+ Suited for electronic and acoustic kick drums.

+ Extremely light on CPU and RAM.
