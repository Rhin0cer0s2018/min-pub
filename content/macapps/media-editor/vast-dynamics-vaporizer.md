Vaporizer2 is our flagship hybrid wavetable additive / subtractive VST/AU synthesizer / sampler workstation. The intention of this development is to create an alias-free versatile high-performance wavetable sound engine with low system CPU resource usage.

HIGHLIGHTS

State-of the art wavetable engine with four independent alias-free wavetable oscillator banks with up to 24 oscillator unison
Low system CPU resource usage – even with more than 1.000 oscillators playing

Groundbreaking wavetable editor with a vast number of editing possibilities including frequency shift, smooth, clean, bend and bloat for single-cycles, parts of single-cycles or even whole wavetables

Easy-to use wavetable draw mode with smooth Bezier curves and snap to grid function

Mix-in, amplitude modulate, interpolate or normalize wavetable cycles

Generate FM, PWM, harmonic morphed / reduced, low pass / high pass / band pass / comb / formant filtering and even hard sync wavetables out of an arbitrary single cycle waveform

Morphing and phase shifting of wavetable cycles

Import and change standard (Serum, Icarus) format wavetables – also simply via drag and drop

Additive synthesis section that allows to freely edit all harmonics and phases in real-time

Sampler section (wav / aiff / ogg / mp3) with loop points, loop start modulation and key tracking

Resample samples to wavetables with pitch detection



Intelligent polyphonic portamento / glissando (you need to hear it!)

Mono legato mode or polyphonic 4 / 16 voice modes

Three effects busses including 4 x oversampling and mono cutoff to preserve a clean low end

10+ highly parameterizable effects including reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, bitcrush, eq, compressor, limiter, flanger, phaser,
comb filter and more

All effect times and durations can be synced to DAW

State of the art filter section (30+ different types) with 4 x oversampled LPF (biquad, state variable and diode ladder
  implementations) plus high pass, all pass, band pass, notch, shelf, comb and scream filters – all with resonance
Ve

ry steep filter curves for punchy basses

Real-time filter response display


Innovative audio routing system for all sound generators, filters and effect busses

Five freely editable MSEG envelopes with loop function

Five LFOs (per voice – means up to 80 LFOs in total) with smooth generation optimized for lowest frequencies with ramp and phase

that can be set per voice or global – can be synced to the DAW


Built-in arpeggiator that is freely editable and supports polyphonic modes and hold

Three step sequencers that can be synced to the DAW

All parameter knobs / sliders automatable



Comes with a daily growing number of presets – free regular updates on the website

Easy to use and intuitive user interface that is freely scalable and resizable even up to 4k and more with many drag and drop
features

Life-long free update policy!

Plus: the sound is stunning!



Changes:

Significantly improved filter section (sound and CPU consumption).

Significantly improved real-time filter response display.

Added wavetable modulation function Convolution (use with additional convolution tables in tables folder) to add custom wavetable
effects like delay, reverb and filters.

Added wavetable modulation functions Time > Frequency and Frequency > Time to smoothly change between time and frequency domain
(use together with grid function).

Significantly improved modulation system.

Largely extended factory bank now including 300 factory presets.
