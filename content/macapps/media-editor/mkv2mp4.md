MKV2MP4 is an application that can convert video files in the MKV container format to more compatible MP4 video files. MKV2MP4 can convert most common MKV files very quickly, and has a queue for converting hundreds of files at once. MKV2MP4 can be configured to either produce files with perfect compatibility (at the expense of conversion speed) or to do conversion extremely quickly by producing files that are playable on most, but not all players (see F.A.Q.).

Because MKV2MP4 doesn’t re-encode the video track, conversion is fast and the resulting video has the exact same high video-quality as the source file. Note that most subtitles are supported (see F.A.Q.) but some players do not display them.



BLAZING SPEED

MKV2MP4 can convert files so fast because it does not re-encoded video data, but simply copy in a format more compatible MP4 container. You can choose preferences if you want the fastest speed for converting audio or greater compatibility.

PERFECT QUALITY

As MKV2MP4 simply copy the video data in the new container format, there is absolutely no loss of quality, the converted files are perfect copies in pixels. The Full-HD videos are fully supported.

CONVERSION WITH LOTS

MKV2MP4 can convert hundreds of files at once with an easy – cola convenient to use and has many files to automatically add no more work options.

CONVENIENT OPTIONS

MKV2MP4 presents three conversion modes. You can choose the perfect match for files to be played on all MP4 compatible players. Or you can choose the highest speed and continue playing files in most players (especially on iOS devices). In addition, a custom mode in which you can define how to handle arbitrarily audio conversion. There are also options to automatically add files to the queue and then remove them for handling lots. Most captions are also fully compatible (see FAQ).

SURROUND SOUND

If your file contains a surround track, you can use MKV2MP4 to generate files that reproduce 5.1 surround sound perfect on your target device support. MKV2MP4 even supports generating files that play in surround sound on AppleTV, which have special requirements.


Compatibility: OS X 10.10 or later 64-bit
