Devious Machines Pitch Monster Underneath Pitch Monster’s streamlined exterior lurks an absolute beast, capable of 64 voices of sound-warping insanity. Transform a solo vocal into a beautiful choir or robotic melody; turn a mono synth into an orchestra, or your own familiar speaking voice into the rumbling vibrations of Thor, God of Thunder.

With its granular, formant and Robo-tastic vocoder engines, Pitch Monster goes far beyond ordinary pitch shifting. Realtime MIDI control, low latency and 8-voice polyphony mean that it can be
played like an instrument. Pitch and time spread and randomization functions turn ordinary sounds into the fantastical, whilst extreme formant shifting can not only alter the gender of a voice
but mutate it into an entirely different species!

Just don’t turn the knobs too far. You don’t want to get it over-excited.



FEATURES

Harmonize with up to 8 voices of polyphony

Huge 6-octave range

Dial-in 8 voices of unison for a 64 voice stack

Granular, formant-shifting and vocoder engines

Realtime MIDI control

Programmable chord memories, with hundreds of presets

Dual high + low pass filters for fine tonal control

Wide mode for BIG stereo effects

Responsive, low-latency DSP engine.



FORMANT MODE

Formant mode is tailored for vocals but also works with other clean monophonic audio.

If you think of the voice as a series of the pulse from your vocal cords through the resonating chambers of your neck and head then this mode lets you control the speed of the pulses and the
size of your neck and head independently.



CHORD MODE

Chord mode lets you select up to eight notes on the on-screen keyboard to form a chord. This mode can be used to harmonize or add higher or lower energy to a sound. With eight chord memory
slots, you can save and recall chords for live performance.

Build chords for your track in MIDI learn mode, or copy and paste chords between slots and edit them. You can even copy chords to other instances of the plugin.



Compatibility: MacOSX 10.9 or later (64-bit)
