Gifox is a beautifully designed and masterfully crafted app that records your screen into animated gifs – the great alternative between static images and full-size videos. It’s your best companion for:

Micro-screencasts and product demos

Animated instructions and bug reporting

Selective on-screen video capturing


SELECTION MODES

Gifox introduces a completely new way of continuous screen capturing with window selection mode – you select a window and Gifox precisely records it even when it’s moved or covered up by other windows. Free selection mode is also there for you – fast-select any area on the screen and hit record, like you used with the standard grab app / Cmd+Shift+4 command.

Pixel-sharp selection with accurate margins

Only selected window without any overlaps

With or without window shadow

With or without desktop background

CAPTURE CONTROL

A set of capturing options accessible via preferences window let you explicitly control your recording and output.

Record fps

Playback fps

Window shadow

Desktop background

COMPRESSION OPTIONS

Advanced compression options provide complete control over output quality and file size.



Colour

Palette generation

Dithering

SHORTCUTS

Open up Gifox in any selection mode using preconfigured global shortcuts.



Cmd+Shift+5 initiates/stops free selection mode recording

Cmd+Shift+6 initiates/stops window mode recording

Custom shortcuts are coming in April release

SHARING


Easily share your recordings with Dropbox, Google Drive and Imgur with support for more great services underway. We want to know what integrations would be most useful for you, let us know using the in-app feedback form or contacts on our website.



What’s New:



Version 2.2.2:

Improvements:



Support for recording in full-screen mode! Yey!

Failed recordings are no longer auto-deleted when dismissing errors in library.

Selection frame and cursors should no longer be captured at recording start.

Better export error diagnostics and handling.

Disabled shortcuts would bind to letter A on app relaunch.

Compatibility: macOS 10.12 or later 64 bit
