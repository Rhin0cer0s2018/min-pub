iZotope RX 8 Audio Editor Advanced has long been the go-to audio repair and polishing suite for film, television, music, podcasts, video games, sample libraries, and more. With RX 8, we’ve created new tools and improved beloved modules to help you accomplish more in less time than ever. Rescue your rig with Guitar De-noise: powerful tools to control fret squeaks, amp hiss and noisy pick sounds.

What’s New in RX 8

Guitar De-noise

Rescue your rig with Guitar De-noise: powerful tools to control fret squeaks, amp hiss and noisy 
pick sounds.

RX 8 De-hum overhaul

Is that an AC unit you hear switching on in the back of your recording? Or maybe you’re frustrated 
that your drummer lives in an apartment where no matter what room they’re in, you can always hear 
their fridge humming along? Never fear! De-hum in RX 8 Elements is here.

New 32-tab limit for Audio Tabs

Time is precious when editing audio in post. To help you tackle more work faster, RX 8 doubles the 
previous 16-tab limit, now allowing you to view and edit up to 32 files within RX Audio Editor. 
Cover more ground in less time with greater efficiency and in-app real estate.

RX 8 Wow & Flutter module

Physical audio recordings—such as tape and vinyl—inevitably fall prey to the elements as time goes 
by. This often results in pitch fluctuations in those physical recordings. Wow & Flutter is 
designed to correct this symptom regardless of the intensity of the modulating pitch. Use Wow to 
fix longer, sustained pitch drift, and Flutter to correct pitch variances that occur at faster 
rates. Wow & Flutter is the key to performing pitch-perfect music restoration in record time.

RX 8 Loudness Control

Prepare your recordings for final delivery with the detailed level readings and 
loudness-management power of the all-new Loudness Control module. Load preset loudness standard 
targets to ensure your audio conforms to broadcast requirements, and monitor your levels using the 
built-in numeric and histogram readouts for integrated, short-term, and momentary loudness. Plus, 
resize the module to fit your display perfectly and suit your unique workflow.

Spectral Recovery

Restore grainy audio from live-streamed, remote audio calls to crystal clarity with Spectral 
Recovery.

Music Rebalance

With improved source separation algorithms and the ability to generate stems from a stereo 
recording, you can easily re-animate a mix, remove or isolate vocals for a remix, or even create 
and export new stems for further processing and mixing.
