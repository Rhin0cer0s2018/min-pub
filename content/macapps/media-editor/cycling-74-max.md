Max is a visual programming language for the specialized needs of artists, educators, and researchers working with audio, visual media, and physical computing.

Discover a new landscape of sonic possibilities

With MC, objects and patch cords contain multiple audio channels. MC will transform how you imagine sound design, effects processing, and mixing. It might be the closest thing to a mind-expanding drug Max has ever had.

Experience noticeably faster performance

For Max 8, we profiled real-world, messy patches to discover what we could optimize. You’ll notice the difference the moment you launch the application.

Control your patch with hardware — no patching required

We are pleased to announce the release of Max 8.1. This update brings initial Mac OS 10.15 Catalina support and “darkmode” window toolbars on Mac. We’ve also decided to include jit.mo in the distribution as a “factory” package (it has a few improvements as well). Additionally, the Inspector has been improved to have a “per-object” view (among other things). Be sure to take a look at the change log below for the complete details of improvements in this release.

New Features:

• Inspector: save, restore view, disclosure, filter etc on a per-object basis and other improvements
• jit.gl.graph: matrixoutput support
• jit.mo: added to the standard Max distribution
• live.comment: new object – text color follows live interface colors
• MC: initialbusystate attribute to set the default busy state to zero to avoid high CPU usage
• pattrstorage: added filter bar to client and storage windows
• Themes: allow loading from Packages (interfaces/themes)
• thispatcher: can get path of .amxd
• vst~: valuemode attribute to set output format
