The easy-to-use editing interface lets you creatively edit your video, music and add additional photos, texts and annotations, with motions and transitions for a truly professional-looking movie. With built-in sharing feature, you can easily publish the movie to your web site, blog or directly to Youtube or Vimeo.

Making movies in Filmwizard

Import your own movie clips or record your story into built-in media library, which make the clips easily reuse, and then drop them right into the timeline. With Filmwizard’s essential editor features, you can easily join, split, detach audio and sync clips without overlaps, then add transition effects, annotations and texts and voices.
