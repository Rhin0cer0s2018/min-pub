DRmare Music Converter for Spotify is a utility designed to help you grab your favorite albums and tracks from the popular music streaming service without too much hassle.

Following a quick and uneventful installation, you come face to face with a minimalistic and clean interface that is unlikely to give you any troubles. As indicated in the interface, you can get started by dragging and dropping the playlist, tracks, albums or artists over the interface, as the app can detect the content automatically.

While the app also suggests that you can drop the relevant links to the search bar, you should bear in mind that you need to have Spotify on your system. On a side note, the application automatically launches Spotify when you open it, so it is more convenient to search for the music you prefer.

It is worth mentioning that the application has MP3 as the default file format for grabbing the audio files from Spotify. If you prefer another format, perhaps a lossless one such as FLAC, AAC, M4A or WAV, then you should bear in mind that you can change it from the Preference window.

In addition to the format, you can also configure the preferred channel, which is set to maximum 2, the sample and bit rates. Lastly, you can set the application to archive the output tracks by artist, artist and album or none of these filters.

All in all, DRmare Music Converter for Spotify is an easy to use application that provides you with a quick way to grab the latest music or your favorite artists so that you can listen to them offline.
