Native Instruments Komplete 12 Ultimate Collector's Edition

With bolder effects, smarter instruments, and all the latest features, the Native Instruments Komplete 12 Ultimate Collector’s Edition is a turnkey solution for today’s in-demand sound designer and music producer. Inside you’ll find over 150 products spanning an impressive 90,000 preset sounds and more than 900+GB of content. New features include the award-winning Kontakt 6 sampling engine, with a sleeker interface and three new forward-looking instrument libraries; the new Massive X synth*, successor to the genre-defining Massive and bursting with sonic possibility; and Session Guitarist, which creates folksy acoustic and driving electric tracks as easily as comping chords. These and other favorites, including Reaktor 6, Battery 4, and Guitar Rig 5 Pro, come pre-loaded onto one handy installation drive for instant access.

Features of Native Instruments Komplete 12 Ultimate Collector’s Edition

Below are some noticeable features which you’ll experience after Native Instruments Komplete 12 Ultimate Collector’s Edition free download.

What’s New and Cool

Kontakt 6 + three new libraries

Native Instruments’ award-winning sampling engine is even better in version 6. Fully featured and even easier to navigate, Kontakt 6 unlocks the full potential of your NI and third-party NKS libraries. Onboard scripting and audio routing make Kontakt 6 a true production and performance powerhouse. The Komplete 12 Ultimate Collector’s Edition includes three new Kontakt instruments:

Analog Dreams: with its mood-matching Miami Vice color scheme and treasure trove of ’80s heirloom synths, Analog Dreams is the perfect companion for today’s synthwave creator and nostalgia peddler.

Hybrid Keys*: these hypersampled and pre-processed pianos and keys are based on techniques used by today’s chartbusters. If you’re looking for a ready-made Drake or Lorde sound, you’ll find it here in Hybrid Keys.

Ethereal Earth*: organic textures meet daring wavetables in the Ethereal Earth library. From Mid-Eastern melodics to devastating drones, this library is perfect for soundscaping.

Hybrid Keys and Ethereal Earth will be made available as free downloads upon their release.

Session Guitarist

There’s just no replacement for a strummed acoustic or driving electric guitar in a modern production. Session Guitarist includes the latest versions of two exclusive NI libraries — Electric Sunburst and Strummed Acoustic 2 — for lifelike, organic guitar textures on demand. From delicate arpeggios to convincing palm mutes, Session Guitarist is like feeding your ideas through the mind of a competent session guitar player, with accurate strumming, chording, and leading. More than 100 presets are included to get you started.

Massive X

NI’s flagship synth heads in a radical new direction with Massive X, with more sounds and more delicious presets to stoke your analog and digital appetites. Massive X looks to be not just one of the best virtual synths on the market, but one of the best synths, hardware or software, of its time.

Session Strings Pro 2

Komplete’s ubersampled 22-piece string ensemble can add new dimensions of realism to your cinematic works and pop productions. Smart Play creates sophisticated diatonic harmonies based off single-note inputs. Rhythm Animator creates impressive patterns with step sequencer-like ease. And assignable articulations (slides, staccatos) give players touch control without advanced menu diving.

More instruments, effects, and sounds than ever before

You’ll find over 150 instruments/processors and more than 90,000 preset sounds within the Native Instruments Komplete 12 Ultimate Collector’s Edition. From the endless creative potential of Reaktor 6 to the authentic world-music textures of the Discover Series to the convincing amp sims of Guitar Rig Pro 5, the Ultimate Collector’s Edition has you covered for virtually any production obstacle you might encounter. You also get excellent mix tools from the Solid Mix Series, including studio-style EQ, Dynamics, and Bus Compression processors, while innovative titles such as the unique sample-and-synthesis-driven Form and the multi-mode Replika XT delay make the latest Komplete more flexible than ever.

Hands-on hardware control

If you’re rocking a Kontrol S- or A-series keyboard controller or Maschine creation tool, then you’ll be blown away by the way Komplete 12 Ultimate Collector’s Edition fits into your workflow. Not only can you browse your Komplete 12 library for instruments and effects directly from your hardware, but you can also call up individual presets via the tag/category-based browser and tweak them to perfection without touching a mouse. It’s the perfect combination of software flexibility with the hands-on control you’d expect from a traditional hardware keyboard or groove machine.

Inspiring tools for post-production, sound design, and mastering

Because Komplete 12 Ultimate Collector’s Edition is such a powerful tool for songwriting, it’s easy to forget that it’s perfect for post-production, too. If you produce audio for video on a regular basis, you know that you can never have too much content to pull from. And Komplete 12 really covers all angles — whether you need pulsing tribal drums for an ad, a solemn acoustic piano for a short film, or powerful sound design capabilities to create sound effects, Komplete 12 Ultimate Collector’s Edition has the tools you need. Best of all, the individual products are all very easy to browse through, making your entire creative process, from writing to mastering, totally streamlined. Equip yourself for all your sound design needs, with the Native Instruments Komplete 12 Ultimate Collector’s Edition from Sweetwater.
