## Album artwork finder

Download album artwork automatically with bliss

bliss is an album artwork finder that is simple, fast and accurate. bliss finds and installs album artwork automatically. bliss is fully automated and can even add album artwork to your music in the background, as you add the music to your collection. bliss uses both reputable and expansive sources for its album art.

## Music folder organizer

Assess your current music file and folder structure

Organize your music files and folders by specifying a file organisation pattern. bliss then synchronises your tags with your file names. Choose from different tags to include in the file organisation pattern, and how you want to treat whitespace. You can perform the changes automatically if you like, ideal for large collections.

## Control your genres

Filter genres into a defined subset

Keep track of the genres in your music collection. Music genres are notorious for ballooning as you add more music from different sources. Some genres are general, like ‘Classical’, while some are specific, like ‘Experimental Big Band’. bliss allows you to control which genres are allowed in your music collection.
