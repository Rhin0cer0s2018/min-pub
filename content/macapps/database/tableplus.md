Start getting more done in less time

With native build, simple design and powerful features, it makes database management easier, faster & more efficient for you.

Native, Fast & Secured

Query, edit and save your database easily with a native app that can run fast like a Lambo. It’s also equipped with many security features to protect your database, including native libssh and TLS to encrypt your connection.

Multi Tabs & Code Review

Quickly get a snapshot of your database with multi-tab and multi-window view, as well as stay in control of what you have changed on your database with Code Review.

You don’t need to install any SSH client in order to connect to the server. SSH is a part of TablePlus.

Powerful SQL Editor

We’ve built the best practices for SQL Editor into our default to help you boost your productivity

Shortcut key available

Every function has a shortcut key to keep your hands always on the keyboard.
